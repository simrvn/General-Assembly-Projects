#Post Rules

* The following thread types require mod approval: surveys and AMAs (sharing survey results are fine).
* Low-effort, homework help, ""looking to interview."" posts are not allowed.
* Don't ask for career advice; go to r/cscareerquestions for that.
* Posts that ask solely about learning materials or resources do not belong here (e.g., ""What is the best book for learning X?"", ""How do I set up a website on a Y stack?"", etc.). Those questions should be redirected to the resources of /r/learnprogramming or a subreddit specific to a language/technology.
* Low-effort posts without much context or details will probably be deleted. Posts with no body text will likely be considered too vague and will be removed.
* If your post doesn't actually have a question, it'd better have significant material worth discussing. Threads that consist of just a link, or have a link with minimal accompanying text, are not allowed. Please put effort into setting up the discussion.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi r/SoftwareEngineering!

I'm curious what your development database environment looks like?

I noticed [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/n6eged/do_you_prefer_shared_database_or_local_when/) in r/Database which revealed quite a few folks using shared development databases, whereas some clearly prefer their own local copies.

I wonder if this community has different opinions?

I must admit I was a bit surprised to see as many responses about using shared environments. I've heard from others (and experienced myself) that these shared instances can easily end up changing beneath your feet without you realising and causing all sorts of problems. Schema changes getting applied that conflict with your own, data disappearing or changing unexpectedly, etc. How prevalent are these in your day-to-day?

My other questions for those of you who do use a **local environment** is how is it set up?

* Is it running in a container via something like Docker?
* Is it your own instance in a cloud hosted environment?
* Have you installed the engine itself as a native service on your machine?
* Is it setup entirely differently?
* How large is it? Is it a copy of production? Generated test data?

,SoftwareEngineering,"I have seen this problem in a couple of projects/companies I was part of:

First when you start the project you setup a staging and a production system and everything works fine. You develop your feature on your local machine, push it to staging, the product owner (or whoever) tests it on staging and if everything is fine, it is deployed to production.

If the team is getting bigger and bigger it happens more often that one developer deploys feature A on staging and developer wants to deploy feature B to staging. But she can not deploy it because it takes some time for feature A being tested/reviewed. 

So staging is occupied by one feature which suspends the development of another feature.

In our projects we than either build a second staging system called ""preview"" or ""demo"". Which solved the problem for a while, but if you grow more you will get the same problem. 

Or one time on of our developers tried to create a ""lab"" infrastructure where every branch would get its own running system. After 8 months of work the lab infrastructure still was not working like we wanted it (because often other things became more important and work on ""lab"" was postponed a lot) we gave up on the lab infrastructure. We killed it.

How do you manage this kind of development infrastructure? How do you give your developers the ability to have a running demo environment of her branch to do quality assurance or show to stakeholders?

,SoftwareEngineering,"**TL**;**DR:** How do you structure the transactional messages (email, sms, etc) sending service in your software?

&amp;#x200B;

How do you handle sending messages in your system (emails, sms’s, whatsapp, telegram, etc) to your clients? I already have the necessary apis integrated, I’m wondering how to build the system so it’s flexible and scalable. 

What I'm looking for are personal experiences about dealing with more complex messages systems, dealing with 100+ messages templates that are constantly being changed by the marketing department.

Where would be a good place to store the templates? (we have most of them in .html and .txt files inside the ""server build"" and some in the database). Would an Aws s3 bucket be a better place?

And how to schedule messages after X time? For example, a patient has an appointment after 7 days and 3 hours. We are using Aws sqs queues but it doesn't work very well, and the only alternative I can think involves a database table and a cron job which might be even worse.

How to structure the code? For example, right now we have a cron called BirthdayJob that calls

`TouchpointGateway.sendBirthdayMessage(Patient patient)`

`{`

`EmailService.sendBirthday(patient);`

`SmsService.sendBirthday(patient);`

`WhatsApp.sendBirthday(patient);`

`}`

And inside each service we build the according template and pass it to the according  sender service.

,SoftwareEngineering,"In my Uni, we are learning about architectural patterns, and were discussing a banking ATM system in which instead of a card, the person uses a fingerprint and pin code for account verification/logging in.

Usually, from what the professor has taught us, I believe that the client-server pattern is used in these kinds of systems(specifically ATMs)? However, we have studied broker system and for this particular system I was wondering that the broker system seemed to be more accurate?

From what I thought, there are three different kinds of servers that the bank needs: fingerprint authentication, pin code authentication, and banking database information retrieval and update. The remaining requirements could be handled locally at the ATM itself. The pin code authentication and bank database servers would already be in place.

&lt;p&gt;Usually, from what the professor has taught us, I believe that the client-server pattern is used in these kinds of systems(specifically ATMs)? However, we have studied broker system and for this particular system I was wondering that the broker system seemed to be more accurate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I thought, there are three different kinds of servers that the bank needs: fingerprint authentication, pin code authentication, and banking database information retrieval and update. The remaining requirements could be handled locally at the ATM itself. The pin code authentication and bank database servers would already be in place. All that is needed to be introduced is the fingerprint server and the broker. The broker would direct requests from the ATM machine to the appropriate server.&lt;/p&gt;

All the portals will be accessible from one TLD, so the url will be something like &lt;a href=""https://example.com/school1""&gt;example.com/school1&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""https://school1.example.com""&gt;school1.example.com&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have never built something like this, so I have several questions:&lt;br/&gt;\n1) I&amp;#39;m guessing I can use the site I have as a template to spin off new sites in the new SaaS?&lt;br/&gt;\n2) What is the correct term for this multi-tenant setup so that I know how to speak when I ask questions or do consultations?&lt;br/&gt;\n3) What resources can I use to learn to build such a multi-tenant infrastructure? I have not seen any literature on such indulgences. I&amp;#39;m looking for books, blog posts, tutorials etc on architecting such kind of software or something close.&lt;br/&gt;\n4) What technologies am I looking at utilizing to build out such and what expertise should I be looking for? Is this what stuff like Docker/Kubernetes/containerization is used for in isolating stuff? Or I should be looking at something else?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) What are some potential pitfalls and points of concern that are unique to this endeavor that I should keep in mind when planning this out?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': None, 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': False, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [], 'awarders': [], 'media_only': False, 'can_gild': False, 'spoiler': False, 'locked': False, 'author_flair_text': None, 'treatment_tags': [], 'visited': False, 'removed_by': None, 'num_reports': None, 'distinguished': None, 'subreddit_id': 't5_2zim0', 'mod_reason_by': None, 'removal_reason': None, 'link_flair_background_color': '', 'id': 'nvzbhm', 'is_robot_indexable': True, 'report_reasons': None, 'author': 'chirau', 'discussion_type': None, 'num_comments': 14, 'send_replies': True, 'whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'contest_mode': False, 'mod_reports': [], 'author_patreon_flair': False, 'author_flair_text_color': None, 'permalink': '/r/softwarearchitecture/comments/nvzbhm/question_how_to_rearchitect_a_single_portal_site/', 'parent_whitelist_status': 'all_ads', 'stickied': False, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/softwarearchitecture/comments/nvzbhm/question_how_to_rearchitect_a_single_portal_site/', 'subreddit_subscribers': 15125, 'created_utc': 1623254436.0, 'num_crossposts': 1, 'media': None, 'is_video': False}]",/r/softwarearchitecture/comments/nvzbhm/question_how_to_rearchitect_a_single_portal_site/,,t3_nvzbhm,,,

I am a college student who has to study software design this term. I am pretty new to software design but admire its power a lot.

I really want to study software design, but every time I show my class diagrams to my teacher, he always tells me that my class diagram was wrong without showing any reasons.

I really want to improve this skill to draw class diagram and other diagrams, but can't depend on my current teacher.

Are there any books or courses that could help me develop this skill?

Can I learn the design of other systems that currently working on the Internet, like reverse engineering?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey,

Sorry in advance if this post is all over the place.I'll break it into points, so I can explain it as clearly as possible.

# My background

I've been programming for 13 years, out of which 3 were commercial (employment, contracts) - the rest were on and off freelance or opensource work.I'm currently employed as a mid-tier software engineer specializing in .NET, Vue, and GraphQL - but **I was also told I'll be promoted to senior engineer** by the end of the year, as soon as I gain more insight into the products we're building.

# The issue

Now, here's the issue - **because I'll be a senior engineer,** I'll be more hands-on when it comes to architecture. In fact, it was made clear to me that a few of the projects will be started and led by me, **so knowledge about proper design patterns and architecture could be a great benefit.**

Because of all that, I've started reading up on DDD, CQRS, Microservices, CAP Theorem, and all the related.. - and while **I understand the premise, I can't apply them to my projects.**

I've had no issue building microservices in the past and I realize they require at least basic knowledge of DDD and CQRS to successfully define bounding contexts and implement communication between services - but I've always done it by intuition (it just felt ""right"").

.. but now, when I'm trying to work on my own relatively simple microservices project and try to apply DDD on the service level (having proper layers: Application, Infrastructure, Domain) - I just get into **the infinite loop** and get to a point where I have a folder structure, get irritated and then start remaking it over and over again - it also doesn't help that I have **OCPD**.

I don't know if it's the right place to ask, but I would greatly benefit from a mentor that I could ask now and then whether my structure or implementation is well within the definition of DDD and/or CQRS.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Let's say in your frontend user interface, the user interacts with an object (json object) and you need that object to always be in sync with the backend object (stored in the DB)

A straighforward answer would be that whenever the user does a change to that object you have to call your API backend to save it.

But then:

How do you handle the case when saving the object fails? When that happens, the UI and backend are no longer in sync since the change already happened in the UI but not committed to the database.

How do you handle the case where the save doesn't just store the object as it is coming from the frontend but needs to do some modifications to it? When that happens, the changes made in the backend are not in sync with what the user sees in the frontend.

Considered solution:

Have the backend return the object as it is in the database when the save succeeds or fails so that the UI can use that value to revert back the UI state in case of failure or update the UI in case of success.

But this just does sound very clean to me, in case of failure returning the full object doesnt sound like good practice in addition to having to return message errors. And in case of success it feels overkill to have to rerender the whole UI using the updated object whenever a change is made.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey everyone,

Imagine this: a team where you don’t have to hold anybody’s hand. A team that delivers results with you only minimally getting involved in the frontline work.

It's not a dream.

Weeks ago we had an exciting chat with Mike Seavers (ex-CTO at Riot Games) about building self-managed teams. He shared all the tips and tricks you need to know. He’s working hard to implement the lessons he’s learned over the years.  


**Here are some key takeaways from the interview:**

1. What does the manager do in a self-managing team?

The leader’s job is to coach. You don’t do the frontline work anymore, so you shouldn’t make all the frontline decisions. Your job is to teach your direct reports to solve problems and think for themselves.

2. There are reasons not to build an autonomous team

Leaders often have a desire to get to the frontline and do the work. Making decisions for your team is often quicker than having them take time to consider those decisions carefully. However, you come out ahead in the long run by letting these go.

3. Communicate your expectations

Let your reports know that you expect them to think for themselves. You can turn it into a company-wide initiative or you can work individually with certain people. Just be straightforward, and give them space to actually do it.

4. Coach your reports instead of deciding for them

When your reports are making a decision, let them know you expect them to come to you with a suggestion. Help them think it through by reminding them of the goals and pointing out potential flaws. They’ll pick up on the process quickly.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Wish you to clarify something, dear fellows.

Imagine that you have two UseCases.

One of them is **CreateCustomerHandler**, other is **SignUpCustomerByGoogleAuthHandler**. So, the **SignUpCustomerByGoogleAuthHandler** has to reuse the **CreateCustomerHandler** to eventually create a **Customer**.

Is it legit to inject **CreateCustomerHandler** to **SignUpCustomerByGoogleAuthHandler** as a dependency? Are there any pitfalls?

Read that it's not recommended to reuse your UseCases, but what to do in that simple case? Extract the whole **CreateCustomerHandler** as **Application Service** and inject it both to the **CreateCustomerHandler** and **SignUpCustomerByGoogleAuthHandler** UseCases?

Is reject considered an error state in a promise, or just a general &amp;quot;the promise could not be fulfilled&amp;quot;? I don&amp;#39;t want to rewrite it using flow control but just with promises, so my other solution would just be to return null or something which is explicitly checked.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering," 

While studying design patterns, I found the following questions in a textbook, and I am having a hard time figuring out the answers.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Re-use an existing class but provide new functionality.**

I believe this could be the Decorator pattern: you can wrap the existing class in another one that provides new functionality.

**2. Be able to replace the implementation of an interface at runtime.**

Here, the ""run-time"" requirement is really giving me a headache. I think this could be the Strategy Design pattern, because it allows for a client to ask the Context which strategy implementation to use. However, the ""run-time replacement"" feels a bit of a stretch here.

**3. Extend the functionality of objects dynamically during runtime.**

Again, the ""runtime"" requirement feels problematic to me. I could argue that the Decorator extends the functionality of objects, and if you have written all the Decorators you need you can pick one of them at run-time.

**4. Decouple clients of a system X from dependencies on subsystems of X.**

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi, I'm a computer science msc student from scandinavia. I'm 24 years old. 

I've been programming, and just generally being a computer geek for 4 years now. 

Like most other software developers, I've been hit by imposter syndrome, having a feeling that I should now more technical stuff than I do. Also like most programmers, I have some areas in which i'm pretty proud of my skills, and then I have some areas, where my skills are lacking.

The other day, I had a meeting with some co-students, that I am doing a project with, and while doing some programming on our project while screensharing. When I had to do the commit, I first committed, and then I pulled, and boom I had a merge conflict. Most of the time, I have no idea how to solve merge conflicts. I've read a few guides which never seem to work. I ended up deleting the project and cloning again in front of everyone. Super embarrassing.

&amp;#x200B;

So, for me, git is one of those topics that I have never really been taught, and I'm not a 100% on doing it properly.

Another topic that I for some reason am just kinda behind on, is low level languages, and generally low-level stuff. Stuff like knowing what a register is memory pointers,, and how the stack really works behind the curtain.

,SoftwareEngineering," ""It will create a huge mess. What were they thinking?""

The instructions were specific. Copy this column into a new column. If we need a join, then use the new column. Allow the original one to be edited. Reason? Well, because the customer wants it shown in their language.

Trouble was, the original was a primary key. Used for joins all over the code base. Database, services, backend logic, config files... We were looking at enormous maintenance and testing impact.

Whoever had come up with this solution, obviously did not understand this.

Here's the trouble with prescribing a solution like a spec. It's like a one-way hash. It encrypts the customer's needs into software features. But features will not tell you WHY they need it.

Did they really need exactly THIS column to be editable? We pushed back and digged deeper. Turns out no. They just want the frontend to show it in a different language. They did not care which column we use.

When you understand both the customer's needs AND the code base, you'll often end up with slightly different features. And a vastly more efficient implementation.

Inexperienced developers will follow the ""letter of the law"", and make (usually wrong) assumptions about customer needs. And they won't realize the long-term consequences until it's too late.

Experienced engineers will push back with ""why do it THIS way?"". Or, ""this will cause problem X, Y and Z"". They're not being negative. They're doing their job.

In the end, the smarter solution was simply to abstract the DISPLAY of this column into one central piece of code. This logic would then check a second column to see if there was an edit. If yes, display that, otherwise use the original. Primary key left untouched.

HUGE cost saving.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello,  
I'm working on a macroservices (sane microservices as people call it) project and I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around an issue related to DDD.  


In a typical DDD project, you would have 3 layers: Application Layer (AL), Domain Layer (DL), and Infrastructure Layer (IL).

According to major sources on DDD - by default, the dependencies should look like this:  


[Dependencies in DDD](https://preview.redd.it/ml34ox2j4iz61.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=219460dfad8c1b8745befafcd3d01919a6325e86)

This makes sense:  
\- AL is usually an API that gets data or spins logic in DL  
\- IL is storage for POCO's contained in DL  
\- DL is just plain business logic.  
Now, the issues I'm having are - I'm using .NET, GraphQL, and Entity Framework Core (EFCore) for this project.

GraphQL allows sorting, filtering, and pagination of records, among with being able to fetch nested (related) entities with ease - provided it's connected to a queryable source, like `IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;`.  
This generates the #1 issue I have because it enforces that methods in my DL return `IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;` as opposed to my POCO's which aren't queryable.  
So, the dependency chart immediately looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/cloy4l8y9iz61.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6218f47badca3f24cc5cb2365132134b6e2e80f

EFCore allows putting together multiple queries into a single query - thus reducing simultaneous database calls to one and improving performance greatly.  
This generates the #2 issue I have because it enforces that in order to make use of that feature - I have to write the logic in my methods around EFCore's `DbSet&lt;TEntity&gt;` instead of my POCO's.  
So, in this case, the dependency chart would change to this:

In both cases, the shape of DL and its logic has to adhere to AL or IL - which I consider anti-DDD.

The core folder contains business logic, that uses the models in the model folder to manipulate the models, get data from databases etc.

The ""api"" folder contains the code that exposes the core functionalityt, and creates endpoints for the api.

The two test folders just contain tests for the two other folders.

This seems fairly generic, but can anyone tell me if there is a pattern that corresponds to this type of pattern?

I know how to combine the individual orders to create Plans. But **my challenge is how do I update the plan id on respective individual deliveries in real time?**

All the plans and deliveries are stored as Azure collections. I think I should be using a event based stream processing system to update the **plan id on the deliveries** and vice versa in real time. I belive Kafka could be used to achieve above goals but I don't have any prior experience of working on distributed systems. Are there any design patterns that could help me solve this problem.

Each individual delivery is (for now) represented as a pair of two times viz. &lt;strong&gt;pickup&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;drop off&lt;/strong&gt; (estimated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know how to combine the individual orders to create Plans. But &lt;strong&gt;my challenge is how do I update the plan id on respective individual deliveries in real time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the plans and deliveries are stored as Azure collections. I think I should be using a event based stream processing system to update the &lt;strong&gt;plan id on the deliveries&lt;/strong&gt; and vice versa in real time. I belive Kafka could be used to achieve above goals but I don&amp;#39;t have any prior experience of working on distributed systems. Are there any design patterns that could help me solve this problem. The system has to be low latency because the volume of orders is very high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I solve this challenge? any insight would be really helpful. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello and I hope you're feeling well.

I'm   a fairly novice engineer and my experience with attempting to build   microservices has been plagued with the following problems:

1. Request/Response   for service communication with a 'n' number of services has often led   to a huge ball of a system with n:n message connections.
2. Introducing   an event driven style meant adding a layer of indirection (message   queue, event log), complexity in logic in terms of aggregation and   sequencing, and the emergent behavior of the system becoming harder to   ""learn"" and understand.
3. A   gradual loss of abstraction as new business requirements often lead to   having to share/fetch state between services AND a gradual muddling of   initially defined service responsibilities.

Any advice would be appreciated but I do have more specific questions if that may help:

1. How to design service boundaries and responsibilities that will endure new business requirements?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Please note, I'm talking about ""*engineering* manager"", not ""manager"" or ""project manager"".

Whenever there's a discussion about management in software there are hundreds different opinions and ideas. More often than not, it is said that managers shouldn't code, that they should lead and grow people, etc. Sounds great....but here how I observe theory mismatch reality.

Problem 1) When engineering manager can't differentiate ""good job done"" vs ""job done"".

Simple situation, team delivers, tech debt piles up, engineering manager was so non-tech and never looked under the hood. At first glance project looks ok, but under the hood it's crap. In meantime team members got appraised/promoted based on delivery (because the appraising authority - the engineering manager himself - was not able to spot lack of internal quality). And be honest, it's very easy to ""fake"" quality at initial stage of the project.

Problem 2) When engineering manager don't understand the tech stack good enough how he/she can help individual grow?

Example, an engineering manager who used to be Java BackEnd developer, now managing a team with iOS mobile developer. How such engineering manager can spot all the small details required to be improved in order to make a person senior iOS engineer? For me it sounds like placing volleyball coach to be a basketball coach (will work on basic levels, but never volleyball coach will be able to spot all the small details that makes great basketball player).

,SoftwareEngineering,"(cross posted in r/legal but thought I'd ask here too )

Context:
==========

I work at a healthcare insurance company. There are Accessibility compliance rules that our websites have to follow. 

The rule is that a ""reputable"" third-party Accessibility evaluation company will give a certification that our websites are up-to-par with the Accessibility rules stipulated by the government (called 508 compliance).

We (my team especially) dealt with a very shitty 3rd party company. So we switched to a better one, but waaay too costly.

While dealing with the shitty one my team and I had to actually do the actual work fixing the accessibility, and thus I gained a lot of insight in doing this right. I had to learn WCAG /ARIA rules because of how shitty the third party vendor was.

Also doing ARIA changes are really annoying to software developers, but I am weird in that I kinda like it.

So while learning all this I found out that there's a free MIT-licensed open-source engine (https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa) that can automate some of the ARIA assessment. 

IDEA:
============

So, I thought I could be the company that my employer needs. I can offer a mid-level service that is better than the shitty one we use, and cheaper than the best one in the market. 

The service will be white-gloved so I'll also do code changes and work with design changes too, going beyond just finding accessibility issues but fixing them too.

I'll also offer continuous evaluation of the site and alert them when accessibility falls out.


My Concerns
===========

Certification has to be coming from an independent third party accessibility assessment company. I wouldn't be completely independent.

However there isn't really any way to lie about accessibility compliance - you either have website that has it or doesn't have it.  So, my potential new company's certification is on the line if accessibility is out of compliance. This is especially true involving auditing public-facing websites.

What I'm more concerned is perhaps even offering this service might look bad on me and be on the crosshairs of my direct manager of potential people that can be let go. Or even gain envy of others and have that reflect as having a bad working environment.


QUESTION:
===========

Sure the right answer is ""don't do it"". However my quesion is - if I were to do it - what would the steps be to secure myself and my assets? How would I approach my current company in offering this service?

,SoftwareEngineering,"I recently posted about an issue with an asymmetric team with one if the issues of having a ""hyper-performer"". I just wanted to touch on this topic a bit, why I used this term.

Let me start with a hyper-performer to me doesn't mean something intrinsic. They are just very good at what they do in the specific environment in which they do it. Now that I got that out of the way, I would like to respond to some areas of discussion.

1. They're fast/cranking out code: In my situation, this is not the case at all. The person I was discussing is actually very slow at development. They can take 2-4 times longer to do a project and 10 times longer if that project involves a system that they never worked in. In the sense of what they do, they are very slow, one of the slowest.
2. They make complex systems, they should make them simpler: That's the issue. They're dealing with complex problems and they are making the system reasonably simple without being simplistic. They actually have a knack for cleaning up other people's code and simplifying it. Many people and teams tend to organically grow their feature creep iteratively until the system becomes so complex that they can no longer support it. Either as bug fixes or feature enhancements. This person can usually re-factor the design and code in such a way that there is much less code and the code is easier to follow.
3. They should better define the projects so that others can better work on them without need gross levels of feedback or to always pair: This goes back to the complexity of the problems at hand. The projects themselves are generally small, but with innumerable edge cases that need to be handled with a combination of explicit design and implementation. It is common for a story to be something like 2 weeks of design and 3 days of coding. And if the person who's doing the coding doesn't understand the meaning of the design requirements. I've seen failing projects that entire teams spent man-years working on, and this person took over, spend about 1 month doing nothing but thinking, then cranked out a few thousand lines of code in a week and was done. Shipped and never touched the project again, been running for years in heavy use.
4. Performance is relative to the company, could be a bad company: Very possible. I don't claim that we have the best in the industry for engineering skills like a Google or Netflix. But we are an industry leader and over half of our engineers have been working with the company for 10-20 years and we recently went on a hiring spree, so that percentage used to be larger. We have very low turn-over and everyone is very friendly. I should also mention that we've even partnered with Google, Microsoft, and some other large companies because they desire our expertise. And all of them backed out of attempting to do what we do because it's so difficult. To be clear, Googles want a mostly hands-off system. Our problem domain is fundamentally very hands-on, and designing our systems to deal with minimizing support while handling edge cases is a difficult problem. We have to embrace failure and streamline the process to either allow the customer to fix it themselves or for the system to clearly communicate the problem in a proactive manner. Googles excel at having employees with immense technical skills in a wide range of computer science related issues. We excel at employees having deep domain understanding and expertise. Several of our largest projects were actually required by law for a company, and when they went to our competitors, they all turned them down. They came to us in desperation and we(as a company) almost turned them down, but this one person felt confident and pulled it off as they lead the project and implemented many of the systems nearly solo. &lt;-- we're stopping this practice going forward
5. Troubleshooting, doing what specialists can't: I've been at the company for a long while and one of the feats this person pulled off was with a firewall appliance issue. We had a $500,000 firewall setup that came with a support contract. One day we had an issue with a customer claiming their HTTPS connection was faulting to our web API. This was a big customer with many millions in contracts riding on this working. The first few days Ops, network services, architects, and principal and lead engineers were scrambling to figure this out. Once they hit their end of their rope, they called in for the support contract. The firewall vendor sent some people over. They spent another several days trying to figure it out. Then the firewall vendor reached out to a 3rd-party that also so happens to sell support services for their appliance. Flew them out across country to us. Spent another several days. By this time there was a near 24/7 meeting-room full of people going in and out with everyone and their laptops in there, and people in the datacenter trying to sniff traffic and other things. This ""hyper-performer"" flagged down the VP of operations as they walked passed and asked about what was going on. The VP humored them and forwarded the original email sent by the customer describing the issue, and nothing else. This person sat there for several hours staring at the wall, then suddenly got up and wanted to run something past me. Stated a few facts as known by what the customer said, then made a bunch of assumptions based on what everyone else probably already checked out. He then proceeded to state a bunch of axioms that I agreed to for sake of argument. Then led me down a trail of eliminating areas where the issue could be occurring based on those axioms and assumptions. And in the remaining areas, he started listing off possibilities and likelihoods.  Finished with what they thought was the most likely cause and a test to falsify it. They're not very fast about things, but they described how to test this in enough detail that I was able to script some stuff and not only reproduce the issue on demand, which is more than what anyone else could do, but also fit their conjecture as to why this is happening. We went to the meeting room and pulled someone out to explain what kind of setting they would be looking for. That person went back to the room and relayed the information. About 30 minutes later they confirmed it fixed the issue. This is their ability in a nutshell. They don't exactly do things ""faster"" than people, they do things that other people can't do. With the understanding that ""can't"" is a continuum. The closer to ""can't"" people get, the faster this person is relative to them. Given a large enough company, there is always something that someone ""can't"" do and this person has a full time job dealing with ""complex"" projects.

People: Stop treating us like replaceable cogs

Also people: 10x doesn't exist, anyone can do what they do aka we're replaceable cogs

Sorry for this wall of text, but I think we're entering an age where we need to start recognizing unique abilities that people have and not treating everyone like a replaceable cog. A team of people compliment each other, not only because they work together, but because they fill in talent gaps for each other.

When people say there aren't ""10x"" programmers, I call BS. People are looking for gods that can do anything and everything. That is not the case. They are people that seem to have a unique ability that if used correctly, greatly benefit others. Stop looking for a person that is 10x faster and look for a person who makes 100 people 10% faster. 10% faster can be gained by increased performance or reduced support.  In many cases they may be more like a one-trick-pony.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi everyone, msc computer science student here.

I'm currently taking a course in software architecture, and I have to do an assignment where I should derive some architectural view/model from a preexisting system.

It's rather freeform, I can decide for my myself what language the target application/system should be written in. It's also completely up to myself whether to use a tool (for example one that could automatically create a module view model).

Using the view that I derive, I then have to say something clever about the application. Like, maybe there are some anti-patterns, maybe it is made using conflicting architectural methods etc...

I think I want to do a python application, and write the code for analysis myself. But i'm locked in on it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, i'm looking for some good idea's for metrics and view's that I could use to say something meaningfull about a application. Something creative!

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my tentative ideas are stuff like looking for code duplication, warnings regarding overly complicated controller methods, and maybe something as simple as measuring lines of code.

I could also use a graph drawing library to draw a graph of all the modules. 

At this point i'm still in the early phases, and are trying to squeeze my mind for measureable things, that  I can use my view to say something meaningfull about the state of the application.

I would be really interested in good ideas. I'm not looking for anyone to do my homework for me, but rather just some creative inspiration. Or maybe some metrics that are just a bit different and unexpected

,SoftwareEngineering,"So all the sources I have are either very short or very ""words words words"" on this without any examples. I want to make sure I understand the concept behind this so I'll give you my understanding and we'll work from there.

So the way I understand SOA is that you design software using services that already exist so you don't have to design and implement them yourself. Your job is to link them together to create working software.

For example: We build a webpage. We use paypal for payment processing. Is that an example of SOA? I just integrate that on my webpage and I'll build whatever is necessary to make it work on my end. In this example:

Paypal would be the service provider. They implement the whole payment processing on their end. Who would be the service broker? Is my webpage the service consumer (because my webpage uses that service)?

If my example is correct, I have a few questions still: Why is scalability a big thing in the conext of SOA? All I do is delegate stuff to someone else? How does my webpage scale well because of that? Isn't the service provider the one to worry about scalability? Because all I would do is to link the services together.

Isn't the interoperability aspect just that I link these two together?

I want to make sure I understand the concept behind this so I&amp;#39;ll give you my understanding and we&amp;#39;ll work from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the way I understand SOA is that you design software using services that already exist so you don&amp;#39;t have to design and implement them yourself. Your job is to link them together to create working software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: We build a webpage. We use paypal for payment processing. Is that an example of SOA? I just integrate that on my webpage and I&amp;#39;ll build whatever is necessary to make it work on my end. In this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paypal would be the service provider. They implement the whole payment processing on their end. Who would be the service broker? Is my webpage the service consumer (because my webpage uses that service)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my example is correct, I have a few questions still: Why is scalability a big thing in the conext of SOA? All I do is delegate stuff to someone else? How does my webpage scale well because of that? Isn&amp;#39;t the service provider the one to worry about scalability? Because all I would do is to link the services together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t the interoperability aspect just that I link these two together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Resuability and &amp;quot;loose coupling&amp;quot; aspect is just that I could replace one service for another if I need to, right?&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"I'm in an uncomfortable situation of having a hyper-performer, 3 level 4 engineers, and a level 1 on the same team. The level 1 is having difficultly understanding and contributing to the work the seniors are working on, which is kind of excluding them from participating properly. And when they do participate, their work has to constantly be corrected because the issues are too complex for them. Being relegated to support is not fun.

The issue the Level 1 is having working with the seniors, the seniors are having with the hyper-performer. The hyper-performer has an incredibly low re-work rate which is causing a feed-back loop of leadership routing more and more complex projects to our team. But many of these projects are being routed our way because they're too difficult for other teams. Essentially, our team is overall becoming responsible for an ever growing collection of projects that no one but the hyper-performer completely understands.

A recent attempt that seems to be working. Many of these complex projects are primarily difficult because of the level of research, clean design, defensive safeties, and subtle nuances. A single poor choice can result in huge amounts of re-work, which is why other teams turned them down. This hyper-performer is instead filling out specifications and pair programming. This allows the others to work on the other 90% parts of the projects that they do understand.

Even worse is when the level 1 is pairing with the hyper-performer. While they get along well, the bar for quality is difficult for the seniors to meet. The level  1 just sees pages of suggestions and required changes. Makes them feel inadequate, no matter how nicely delivered.

While this is a great first step, we still have the issue that the important details and deep understanding is still silo'd. Team velocity is up and more participation, but the bus factor is as bad as it has ever been. While all of these wins sound good, the hyper-performer no longer has any work assigned to them, which they don't like. And the team velocity being up is less about the hyper-performer being a bottleneck and more of them improving the performance of everyone else. The velocity of the complex projects are overall down. Leadership is noticing a reduction in the rate of these projects getting done.

Large asymmetries is a difficult problem.

Update 1: After reading these responses, reflecting a bit and bringing it back to the team, the team owning is more important than knocking out specialty projects leadership wants. We are collectively leaning towards them playing a more mentorship and consulting role than they already are. Their ask was that the team explicitly call out that is how they want the team dynamic.

Even if their expertise is lost in the future, at least the team as a whole can maintain status-quo.

A longer term question is how this will apply to performance reviews. In a way they're moving towards a higher position, but in another way they not doing their official responsibilities as defined by their title. I guess more leverage for a promotion.

The short term issue is we're technically down an engineer, which does affect velocity in different ways. Overall win as they help even senior engineers get unblocked, but fewer stories in flight.

Updated 2: One of the misconceptions about this hyper-performer is they're producing a lot. They are not. They are very slow. The issue is the complexity of the projects. They are relatively small projects that require near perfection in  a situation where no one knows what they want, just want they don't want.

It would prevent most of the toil on which the engineers now spend most of their time, impose some consistency on what is now a jumbled mess, and allow us to add new features significantly more quickly.

However, I am reticent because there is no programmatic way of validating the system&amp;#39;s functioning and the manually created code is so inconsistent. Advice?&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"The old joke I was always told in high school was that software *engineering* was going to be 80% of the time just documenting things.

Plot twist: It's about 20%, while 60% of your time is figuring out why the hell none of the tools and 20% is documenting how to run those tools, config files, test machines/software, build scripts, golden retrievers, etc. which aren't working since either the sw is so goddam old or there was never any documentation in the first place and all of this documentation you're doing is to pay it forward to the next intern or bright-eyed new hire that will be replacing you when you inevitably get sick of this job.

In college, occasionally had an issue, but you are almost always given a pretty straight-forward task and a straight-forward way to set up something like SVN so you get a little experience with setting up your workspace tools but you are primarily focused on good design and code.

In an effort to not make this post a complete negative contribution, I will say what would probably help, although feels like a waste of time to many, is more familiarity with such tools, languages, and debugging THAT instead of the code itself even. And I don't mean step-by-step ""How to Set Up Git In 5 Minutes"" like every Youtube video out there, I mean I don't think kids are being taught enough about low-level knowledge so that when the high-level fancy-pants 3-lines-you're-done code doesn't work, they can at least dig in enough to write an intelligible Github issue or even figure out the issue themselves.

Is college or courses supposed to teach you some of that? Yes, but it won't cover everything, but it should definitely cover common industry standards.

For instance, Ant build was always something that just got tucked away in the back of the IDE, in the back of your mind, until you realize there's no point in downloading a 4th IDE (Intellij) on a computer with already full drives of repos just so you can build something when a commandline would do fine. Except despite clear documentation on commandline Ant, there is some sort of needlepoint accuracy you need for getting the right command to work with the right version of Java for said old codebase. /rant

For the most part, it is working. But, our backlog grooming meetings seems to be not very productive.

First problem: it seems more often than not either the architect or product manager miss the meeting.  Some tickets we can't estimate because we have some questions. We can reschedule meetings and all that, but schedules are packed and I hate doing that game. Are there ways to not need the architect and PM? Some sort of async process?  


Second problem: We spend a lot of time asking product questions and product spends a lot of time saying they will update the mocks/reqs. So we are often stuck in limbo with tickets where we can't estimate because of open questions. Should I pre-screen the tickets and get those questions to PM sooner? The problem I see is that I just end grooming the backlog myself.   


Third problem: When we do have enough information to estimate, the estimate still feels shallow. When devs start working on the tickets little details often come up that make the ticket underestimated. Feels like there is not enough time to focus on each ticket.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello, everyone.

I'd like to share my experience switching from frontend to backend development. Feel free to let me know if you've had a similar experience or if you've got some other perspective.

After 4 years of FE development as an Android and iOS engineer at one company, I jumped ship and signed on with another company. My new company had an iOS app and a Node BE. After a few months of working, it became clear the iOS product pipeline was very light. Sensing a strong need for BE developers, I asked my manager if I could slowly start transitioning away to BE.

As time went on, I eventually worked exclusively in BE development. During my 2 years as a BE developer, I successfully transitioned our monolithic architecture to a micro service architecture and rolled out a SaaS product used all around the world.

My general feeling now is that **BE development is a huge pain in the ass** and that it would be much easier to simply be a FE developer. Let me argue my case with some points.

&amp;#x200B;

1. You need to know a TON of technologies and concepts at the same time. In my time at the company I had to learn:
   1. containerization
   2. infrastructure-as-code
   3. SQL
   4. NOSQL
   5. Lambdas
   6. event queues/streaming
   7. authentication
   8. authorization
   9. security
   10. hosting
   11. logging
   12. middleware
   13. load balancing
   14. API gateways
   15. Distributed Transactions/Sagas  
VERSUS
   16. Algos  

2. The job market is extremely fragmented when it comes to requested programming languages. I'm now searching for a new job and I keep having to skip listings asking for 2+ years in other languages like:  

   1. Rust
   2. Python
   3. Golang
   4. C++
   5. Java
   6. Earlang
   7. Ruby
   8. C#  

3. Sometimes it's very hard to get recognition from management. Nobody gives a shit about your postman/curl demos. Hardly anyone outside of BE development will be able to immediately understand the value of your work without a detailed explanation. People readily clap, smile, and cheer for new UI elements.  

4. You will be on-call and you will work weekends. I have never in my life heard of a FE engineer being on-call.  

5. Scale porn is rampant. Everyone wants you to scale the BE to handle 7 billion concurrent users. This is even true when interviewing at startups with ZERO concurrent users.  

6. Companies can be extremely paranoid/precious about their BE codebase. It can be excruciatingly difficult to make a case for a refactor or some other improvement to a module. Everyone is scared of breaking a BE. Everyone loves a UI refresh.  


Compare all this to simply locking in either (React, Swift, or Kotlin) and riding it out for 6+ years. Compare that to the security of working in an ecosystem/language built and maintained by a literal monopoly.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I always heard the cliche to keep friends out of business and I always took it for granted. I did freelance software engineering with my friends and it was a disaster. 

**TL;DR:** No one respected each other and the business became an unorganized joke.

1. Friends are a distraction. We were off task most of the time because we would talk to each other and BS about so much stuff. We had little organization and will to listen to each other seriously. Irrelevant conversations always snuck in and project completion times skyrocketed from what they should have been. Pair programming is a very useful system in software companies but is counterproductive with friends. Pair programming with this group always turned into group programming, which always turned into 5 people doing all the work with 5 people watching each of their screens doing nothing.
2. If everyone is a friend, then it is hard to establish a hierarchy and actually get things done. With a group of friends, it is emotionally challenging for a bunch of friends to see another friend in a boss role. This creates a lack of respect and gives everyone at the table an opportunity to challenge ideas in order to fit their self interests while hurting the interests of the company. No one wants to listen to their friend talk in a way that makes them seem like they are better than someone. Friends who have gotten used to each other will never be able to transition to roles of respect where someone is over someone else. This can also ruin the friendships because I imagine that it is hard to be friends and goof around with someone whom you had to work under the entire week and vice versa.
3. When money is involved emotions end up playing a large role. We did a project where 75% of the group did all the work and 25% did close to nothing and the 25% were very mad that they were paid accordingly. Each of the 25% justified that they spent about 1/2 of the hours of each of the 75%. The hours of work of the 75%, however, were way more valuable than the hours of work of the 25%. The 25% put in 1/2 the hours, but had almost zero impact on the final product because they were inexperienced. This became a problem as the 75% reluctantly agreed to a pity deal to pay the 25% because everyone was a friend and no one wanted to ruin friendships. That is the inherent problem with this: nothing will be fair if your friendship is on the line. If someone's feelings are in the way and they are your friend, emotions become a significant factor. The reason that this happened is because it is a group of freelancer friends and not an actual company. An actual company would have defined a set structure for payment from the very beginning. This leads to low morale and loss of opportunity to work because why would the 75% want the 25% to be involved in the next project if the 25% are just going to do nothing and take a share of the money? Surely the 75% should just do the extra work alone quicker and they get to keep the money. The only reason this happens is because of the emotional factor and friendships are on the line. Actual companies succeed because bosses are not the friends of the employees. Bosses make the tough impersonal decisions that get the company money, whether it be firing someone or adjusting pay.
4. You cannot fire anyone since they are your friends. Continuing the story above: The 75% were in favor of firing the 25% because from that experience, the 75% realized that the 25% were a liability and would only cause problems. But, of course, the emotional friend factor came into play. What are you supposed to say? ""Hey guys sorry for firing you and excluding you from the club where we make money because I think you are not worth anything positive. Anyway... lets go play some basketball.""
5. When someone is criticized, they see it as a personal attack. When someone was criticized for their work or told that we didn't like it, they took it personally and it always trickled into the personal realm. During normal group hangouts unrelated to work, the 75% would keep bringing up that the 25% should be more experienced and put in more work. This created an awkward environment for fostering friendships and made it feel like people are above others in the personal friendship realm.
6. Any hierarchy was useless. (Similar to the inability to fire someone). Every time someone deserved to be reprimanded, they would always deny their wrongdoing to the accuser and not take any punishment seriously. ""Okay, you say that I am not putting in enough effort... I'll just not care."" This happened because everyone knew that their friendship connections were guarding them from being fired or reprimanded. It is an idiotic concept. Why should your business decision have an effect on your friendship? Alas, everything always became personal. There was an incident where person A disrespected person B in front of the entire group in a very unnecessary way to prove a point that person B did something wrong when person A even agreed with Person B's point. Person B agreed with the criticism but found person A's wording very dishonest and disrespectful. They spoke privately and tensions just rose and led to awkward situations.
7. The qualifications for a good business partner are not the qualifications of a good friend. The biggest mistake was to assume that everything would run smoothly because everyone was a friend. Someone just has to like their friend and have fun with them. Someone, however, needs to respect a business partner and guarantee that they get work done. We couldn’t also just not include the unreliable members of the friend group because we though that would be rude. ""I don't want to make them feel bad. We can find something for them to do."" NO. If you want to tank a company, you pity hire people, make up useless random tasks for them to do, and then pity pay them. What I thought were competent people who could learn and adapt to software development turned into 2 groups: Those who already knew coding and software development and those who didn't. This is because no one saw this freelance group as long-term since it was just a bunch of friends. This led to people not wanting to learn  or reluctantly learning coding skills because they would not use them in the jobs of their major field, even if it was STEM.
8. Slacking off was the norm. No one wanted to come to meetings. Do you really want to listen to your friend order you to come to a meeting that you don't want to attend? Definitely not. Since people didn't take terminations and punishments seriously, there was no incentive to come to meetings. This led to only the dedicated members knowing everything and the less dedicated had no idea what the company was doing and and needed constant updates to stay relevant. If some people did not attend a meeting, the event would collapse. If your boss tells you to go to a meeting, you go to that meeting. If your friend tells you to come to a meeting and you notice 5 friends already can't go, you say ""Nah there is no point because 5 people are already not going."" The worst part of this was when work hours and meeting would devolve into videogame sessions and unrelated conversations because people had the attitude: ""There is no point of doing anything serious because only some of the group is here.""
9. Very few of the group knew how to run a business and their decisions were often drowned out or criticized by those who did not know what they were talking about. Talks of ""Hey we should get \[insert useful software or technology here\]"" turned into ""I am not helping pay for that. You can use your money if you want.""

Things I would have done differently:

1. KEEP WORK AND FRIENDS SEPARATED
2. Privately recruit members instead of the whole friend group if I chose to work with friends at all.
3. Establish a hierarchy and an attitude of no BS early on.
4. Carry out terminations and loss of privilege when appropriate.

We can find something for them to do.&amp;quot; NO. If you want to tank a company, you pity hire people, make up useless random tasks for them to do, and then pity pay them. What I thought were competent people who could learn and adapt to software development turned into 2 groups: Those who already knew coding and software development and those who didn&amp;#39;t. This is because no one saw this freelance group as long-term since it was just a bunch of friends. This led to people not wanting to learn  or reluctantly learning coding skills because they would not use them in the jobs of their major field, even if it was STEM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slacking off was the norm. No one wanted to come to meetings. Do you really want to listen to your friend order you to come to a meeting that you don&amp;#39;t want to attend? Definitely not. Since people didn&amp;#39;t take terminations and punishments seriously, there was no incentive to come to meetings. This led to only the dedicated members knowing everything and the less dedicated had no idea what the company was doing and and needed constant updates to stay relevant. If some people did not attend a meeting, the event would collapse. If your boss tells you to go to a meeting, you go to that meeting. If your friend tells you to come to a meeting and you notice 5 friends already can&amp;#39;t go, you say &amp;quot;Nah there is no point because 5 people are already not going.&amp;quot; The worst part of this was when work hours and meeting would devolve into videogame sessions and unrelated conversations because people had the attitude: &amp;quot;There is no point of doing anything serious because only some of the group is here.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very few of the group knew how to run a business and their decisions were often drowned out or criticized by those who did not know what they were talking about. Talks of &amp;quot;Hey we should get [insert useful software or technology here]&amp;quot; turned into &amp;quot;I am not helping pay for that. You can use your money if you want.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I would have done differently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KEEP WORK AND FRIENDS SEPARATED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privately recruit members instead of the whole friend group if I chose to work with friends at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a hierarchy and an attitude of no BS early on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry out terminations and loss of privilege when appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an idiot for thinking this friend freelancer group could have worked.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey all,

does your company use any git analytics tools to measure productivity and manage the team? I'm referring to tools like WayDev, UseHaystack, PluralSight Flow (previously known as GitPrime). They claim to go beyond just measuring LOC and compute more advanced metrics to measure productivity, such as stuff like ""impact"" or ""throughout"".

I can see why managers would use them but I'm trying to understand from the perspective of the engineer (the one getting ""measured"" or ""managed"").

As an engineer, it seems to me there are a few issues using these tools:

1. I don't trust the metrics to paint an accurate picture of my contributions.
2. Encourages a culture of micromanaging.
3. As an employee, I feel like I'm being treated as a workhorse. My manager is just trying to increase my throughput.
4. I also don't see how it benefits me at my work (it is just a tool for my manager to collect and present metrics to his manager).

What are your thoughts on these tools? What's the context of your manager using these tools?

Edit:  really appreciate all the comments so far! Seems to me that people are generally ok if the tool is use to spot macro trends instead of measuring individual productivity. But are they really good tools for spotting trends? Aren’t these lagging indicators?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Upfront, thank you all for your time reading this!

I need some architecture/workflow advice for an app I'm building which contains: 

\- External Identity provider

\- Internal User Records, made unique by the External Id Provider's Id, then my own internal ID, used for relationship mapping

\- Client side ui is a React App

\- Backend is .NET

I've built apps before with similar structure, but this is the first time that I'm responsible for the both the Identity side, and internal user side, of the app. 

I'm having trouble engineering the best way to organize this workflow. Here are my thoughts at the moment:

\- User registers with the client side UI. Upon registration, the backend is notified of a new user and thus, creates the internal user

\- The backend is currently setup to auth with JWT, and checks that the user is authorized on each request, but it's only a proof of Authentication, *not* proof that the user is a ""registered user/customer"" in the internal systems.

I thought about implementing some methods that check the JWT info and search whether the user exists internally, and if not, create them, but that could have some serious performance issues since it would be invoked on every request.

My other option right now is to leave authentication itself on the server, but handle the above mentioned ""Existing user"" checks on the API routes themselves. I suppose this would also add another layer of security to the API.

Am I on the right path here? Should I be looking at a different implementation of user creation?

To further complicate things, the app will be a paid service at some point, so I'll need to be able to implement ""roles"" on the routes, which is why i'm leaning toward doing the same for user checks.

,SoftwareEngineering,"We asked 500+ developers and engineering leaders about software development and we finally published the report today. 

Check out the research data on the latest trends in software development. The report covers the effect of COVID, tech trends, tools, hiring, performance, and more!

**Highlight:**

**1. COVID didn’t kill the industry**

Over half of the tech companies were only minimally affected by the pandemic and almost as many experienced positive effects as negative effects.

About one in three tech companies was forced to downsize.

**2. Remote work blew up**

We’ve seen remote work become more accepted over the past few years, but now it’s literally everywhere in the software industry. Almost every tech company allows (or expects) employees to work remotely.

**3. Metrics for software engineers**

The metrics used by average- and top performers are largely similar. But top performers are more likely to pay attention to code readability, while average performers more often don’t use any metrics. This doesn’t require much explanation.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey everyone,

I have this app (it's actually a game, but w/e) in which some data is created and edited by admins and consumed by players.

This data creation and edition is released in batches, so all the time there is a production data and some draft data that will be promoted to production as soon as it is finished and validated. All this data is stored in a somewhat complex and hierarchical database structure.

Imagine, for example, Hearthstone. There's card data stored in database, but designers can edit some draft data until they consider it polished and release a patch. I know that HS is probably not handled like this, but that's an example.

I was wondering if in the moment of the promotion of draft data to production, would it make sense to load it into some in memory db technology such as Redis since it's going to be immutable until the next update.

Am I overcomplicating stuff? I think that the queries will be faster and actually simpler if I do it because I will not load the history of versions and some other metadata.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi there!  


I am currently taking an MSc in Software Development coming from a humanities background (in the UK if that matters). So far the rest of the course has been ok but I am really struggling with my software engineering module. We've been given a group project in which we have to use iterative and incremental development to make a game. The project itself is ok I understand the different UML diagrams required as well as how to actually program the game. My issue stems from the technical report we have to write on it. 

As I said above I come from a humanities background so I have never written or even seen a technical report before. I have zero frame of reference for what it should be like, my other modules (web dev and databases) provided sample reports to show us roughly what the finished product should look like but this module has nothing but a requirements guideline. When I emailed my lecturer about this he said he didn't have any kind of examples for a report, said I just needed the diagrams and the facts and just copy and pasted part of the requirements at me.  

It's due in a couple of weeks and I am beyond stressed about it, I think I have all the info required I genuinely just have no idea what to do with it and what to say about it in a report.

But often it's followed by ""unless"" statement. It goes more less like this:

""
Always go with refactor, unless:
- code is not maintainable
- adding features takes tremendous amount of time
- each change creates bugs in different parts of the system
- code is lacking any structure
- redesigning a component results in a complete rewrite of that component anyway, because the existing design is so fubar that there's nothing worth saving
- the coupling of components is so high that changes to a single component cannot be isolated from other components (redesign of a single component results in a cascade of changes not only to adjacent components, but indirectly to all components)
- onboarding of new developers takes long weeks
""

... and then comes my project (a transactional module within e-commerce application), where all of the above are true and yet people advice me to go with refactor.

&lt;p&gt;But often it&amp;#39;s followed by &amp;quot;unless&amp;quot; statement. It goes more less like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;
Always go with refactor, unless:
- code is not maintainable
- adding features takes tremendous amount of time
- each change creates bugs in different parts of the system
- code is lacking any structure
- redesigning a component results in a complete rewrite of that component anyway, because the existing design is so fubar that there&amp;#39;s nothing worth saving
- the coupling of components is so high that changes to a single component cannot be isolated from other components (redesign of a single component results in a cascade of changes not only to adjacent components, but indirectly to all components)
- onboarding of new developers takes long weeks
&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and then comes my project (a transactional module within e-commerce application), where all of the above are true and yet people advice me to go with refactor.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Don't get me wrong, I'm first to help and train younger colleagues, but sometimes (actually very often) there are people who just shouldn't be into software development at all.

Few noticeable examples from last few days, is when guy was testing a method which gives 50% discount on order (division by 2) with an assert that takes input and divide it by 2 as well (so copied the exact body of the tested function).

I've spent 30mins explaining him why it's wrong, and he was so defensive about his code that I lost hope.

Another guy created a function that returns bool, but also inside the function made that it returns TRUE for invalid input, which is separate business case. Basically function has 3 possible outputs, but he choose boolean as return (and no exceptions). Then he coded usage if this function around these limitations (a hack). I've spent an hour explaining him that this function is losing piece of information, and next developers who'd like to consume that function would be confused.

Again, guy was super defensive, couldn't admit or couldn't comprehend this issue.

So it makes no profit at the moment since the development of it was never intended for commercial purposes. I never pitched it to anyone nor never said to anyone I want to sell it. He's making the offer.

This is what he sent me. I'll use hashtags in place of the CEO name and the company:

I'm going to need you to give me a price of me buying you out.

And at a 100%. Meaning I will own it.

I'll take a look at your offer and after a couple of months, will give you direct feedback to your offer and if I like it, we will begin the paper work.

Thanks

Yours Faithfully

\########### CEO

\###########

So we've actually known each other for a couple months now, and he did make it clear that he's interested in the app more than once.

He knows that a lot of work would still have to be in to get it near a competitive level, since right now as it stands, it just has basic features and mediocre design.

I'm thinking perhaps I should let him buy since he may make more use of it then I have.

What offer should I put down.

I assume the time I put into it would be one of the factors I should consider, which was 6 months of work, from start to finish.

I wouldn't mind hanging to a percentage of the app, but not too much that I have to be the one still putting work into it. I wouldn't mind profiting, but I have no interest to continue working on the app myself.

I'd appreciate some advice.  


Edit: Just want to let everyone know that I am reading everyone's feedback and I appreciate everyone's advice. I'll try to respond to some of the comments that have questions in them.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi there! I've been working as Software Engineer almost 2 years now mostly with technologies like Go, GCP, Terraform, Graphana, InfluxDB, PosterSQL and for some time with AWS Lambdas.

In meantime I've done like 20 small/medium projects. Most of them were abonded because I didn't see anything to learn from them anymore. That's basically how i do. I come up with an idea, do main part of some project and if it becomes boring or new things to me have ended I abandon it. I like it that way because I do only new things and what I want to do is to learn as much as possible.

I've recently done 2 small projects aiming in learning AWS EC2, Lambda, SNS, VPC and maintaining it with Terraform. I know that I'm not expert with that but I got the idea :) 

I want to keep aiming on learning AWS related things but I need project idea because I find it easier that way instead of just learning about pure AWS or anything else. I also wanted to learn software engineer/programming related technologies like Redis, ELK stack or Kafka.

&lt;p&gt;In meantime I&amp;#39;ve done like 20 small/medium projects. Most of them were abonded because I didn&amp;#39;t see anything to learn from them anymore. That&amp;#39;s basically how i do. I come up with an idea, do main part of some project and if it becomes boring or new things to me have ended I abandon it. I like it that way because I do only new things and what I want to do is to learn as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently done 2 small projects aiming in learning AWS EC2, Lambda, SNS, VPC and maintaining it with Terraform. I know that I&amp;#39;m not expert with that but I got the idea :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to keep aiming on learning AWS related things but I need project idea because I find it easier that way instead of just learning about pure AWS or anything else. I also wanted to learn software engineer/programming related technologies like Redis, ELK stack or Kafka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How dou you guys find project ideas? Skip sentences like &amp;quot;do what you are interested in&amp;quot; etc :D

,SoftwareEngineering," Hi Guys,

I need your views on a problem statement that I have been working on for the last few months.

The model that I am building is a text-based model, where the users enter some sentences every day and select the target labels. The model gets trained right when the user enters a sentence and a label.

The targets are specific to only that user. The user has the ability to create a target label on the fly and the model gets trained. In this case, the model gets trained with the new target label and can predict is the next time onwards.

For example, the user can enter:

Note number | Sentence | Target

1| I eat a banana | Fruit

2| I cleaned my house | Task

3| I went jogging | Walk

I am using a Naive Bayes model for this and it works perfectly fine.

The catch is that the target labels are not fixed. And I need to scale this across many users (close to 1000). User 1 can have 10 labels and user 2 can have a completely different set of 7 labels. Also, some set of words can mean something else for user 1, and something else for user 2 (For example- Jogging means Walk for user 1, but means Exercise for user 2). So, conceptually there is no way I can combine the data of multiple users to create a global model because other users' data can contaminate the probabilities of the labels, even if I keep userID as a feature.

Now. the model size is never more than 1-1.5MB for a single user. My question is that does it make sense to create a per-user model, or is there a way to create a global model. Also, please do not suggest neural networks because I need to make them cheap + highly accurate + fast. The naive Bayes model works perfectly for a single user system.

I have never worked with such a setup where we can have a per-user model. Is this something common in the industry? I will be deploying this on AWS, and as per my experience and also while preparing for the ML specialty exam, I learned that we can deploy a model in Sagemaker, BUT usually it is used for a global model.

**In short, my question is that is this a common approach in the industry to have many small but powerful per-user models? If yes, how do you deploy this? (AWS specific answers would be greatly appreciated)**

For those who may have concerns about model evaluation, I have a framework to measure the performance of these models, and model diagnostic is mostly on the NLP logic that we use on the text, so it is common for all users. And since Naive Bayes does not have many hyperparameters to tune, I have created a self-healing self-learning model, and it works well for 1 user system without any changes to the model.

I can elaborate on this if you have any questions.

For the 2nd time in my career I have joined an organisation which duct taped its core project codebase (you know, spaghetti, lack of any architecture, no dry, race conditions, business logic in SQL, etc.).

Second organisation however, spends millions monthly per marketing only, not mentioning salaries of 200-300 people in tech department.

,SoftwareEngineering," We traced it to a particular piece of code. It was complex. It was slow. And it had no test coverage.

The first impulse was to jump in and ""improve"" the ugly bits. But there were too many scenarios. For each combination of inputs, we had to ensure it still gives the same output afterwards.

It's hard enough to add unit tests to legacy code. We were facing the cost of creating myriads of tests. And manual testing was out of the question.

Fortunately, this is nothing new in software development, and other developers have suggested various tricks for handling such situations.

Using one of these techniques, I got us a smooth ui performance within a couple of hours, with *no new tests required*, and *without breaking anything*. I call it the record-and-compare test.

Here's how it works.

1. Identify the piece of code needing a change. It could be spread over several functions, several classes.
2. Create a throw-away library and paste this code into it. Create a single function to execute it. Add parameters to the function, for whatever the code requires to run.
3. Follow the compiler errors. If a missing dependency affects the behaviour of your code, then copy-paste it into your library. If not, then mock it out.
4. Write all output of the code into a text file. This includes return values, output parameters, events fired, database updates. Any side-effects.
5. Make unpredictable output predictable. If you execute your function with the same parameters twice, you should get exactly the same output. Make new database id's zero-based. Make dates based from a relative start date. Etc.
6. Create a single unit test, make it iterate through all the combinations of your function's input parameters, and execute it repeatedly. Use your knowledge of the business domain to exclude nonsense input.
7. Run the test and rename the output file to something like ""*expected-results.txt*""
8. Add a single assert condition: confirm the actual results equals the expected.
9. Add a timer.

Now you can refactor and improve the code, until you get the best performance. All the while executing your test to ensure you're not breaking something. Once done, copy your changes back into the real code base, and throw away your temporary test library.

If you think about it, you'll notice this technique also applies to other refactoring needs, not just performance improvements.",t2_2a1dvrh8,False,,0,False,"We were stuck fixing an ""unacceptably slow"" bug.",[],r/SoftwareEngineering,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_mh8pid,False,dark,0.78,,public,10,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,10,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1617233658.0,text,6,,,text,self.SoftwareEngineering,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We traced it to a particular piece of code.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello all! About 3 weeks ago, I began interviewing for software development jobs for the first time in my life. I am a career switcher (used to be in finance), and learned to code self-taught through 2 tech startups I founded. Going into the market, I have been completely lost as to what level or company to place myself in to increase my odds of success. Not only do I not have a CS degree, but I’ve also never been an engineer-employee and, being a business owner, have not even been an employee in 4 years.

I have 2 years hands-on programming experience but 4 years experience managing software projects and engineers. 

I have some feedback from the market that I thought I could share, and maybe you guys could advise me as to 1)what size/industry company to go after, and 2) what position. 

The Good News: 
The positive response to my resume has been overwhelming. After a few hours of pure online cold outreach, I got 20 job interviews within 3 weeks. Something like a third of these interviews were from companies and recruiters who reached out to me. These positions are generally flat “software developer” roles or in rare instances “engineering manager.”

The Bad News: 
I do great at behavioral, leadership and general tech knowledge interviews, but so far, seemingly not good enough on the actual coding parts. I’m petrified of live coding in front of other people; I hate coding with a timer on; and I refuse to get into leet code. I’m happiest when it’s a coding project I’m being evaluated on, and second happiest on non-supervised tests. Sometimes I feel what job I get is less about the pay/level/company, and more about what interview process the company is using, and whether that feeds into my weaknesses or strengths. My score on timed coding tests are 19/20, 4/5, 2/3 and, in a live coding, feedback that my code was at a more “junior” level. None of this has so far been good enough. 

The Results: 
Tiny (&lt;15 people) startups love me but reject me (it’s kind of mutual) because they need an expert coder that can do full stack (I can’t) 

Small startups (20-100 people) are on the border. They either go ahead with me, or depending on how many engineers they have, they say they want to reach back out to me in 1 month, 6 months, 1 year etc, when they have more seniors in place to train me. One mid size company said I should try for engineer manager role because of my management experience. 

No big company has interviewed me. 

My current plan is to just keep applying, hoping for projects, or for a friendly coding test at the flat software engineer level. It’s exhausting though to do all the tests and projects. 

Any advice on how to target so my chances are better? What should I be applying to?

So I got accused of ""over-engineering"". And for a while there, I dangled dangerously close to that cliff called ""the prima donna developer"".

This was one of my earlier positions. I was still coming to terms with this divide between management's need for getting things done, and the developer's need to do things right.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello everyone, thanks for taking the time to read this. 

I'm about 3 years into my career, got into a software engineer position fresh out of college, no prior internships/experience. I also took lots of gaps in my college career so my technical knowledge was/is very spotty. This company helped me grow so fast, my technical skillset grew exponentially the first year, year and a half. This was probably the most challenging time because I had so little to bring from what I learned and had to learn a whole bunch of stuff, but it was also the most satisfying/fun because I felt like I've accomplished so much more in a year than the previous 5-6 years I spent in school. I worked hard and I was able to get recognition for my input and I was given more responsibilities as a developer to lead parts of feature/project releases.

But then due to having lost our team leads, I was given **even more** responsibilities (managing &amp; leading projects) , and that landed me in a senior position on my second year (note: this company also overinflates titles/roles so I'm more of a engineer II at best). Now fast forward a whole year -- I find myself spending 95% of my day delegating/researching or designing/doing the grunt work that the previous team lead would have done, and the other 5% of my day is maybe filled with actual coding work. I'm not sure that there is a plan to find a replacement for the lead role, and I'm not comfortable with even attempting the position because I know I still don't have the fundamental technical skillset down.

More and more, I've been finding myself unhappy and resentful with my current role vs responsibilities and I have so much going on in my mind that I'm honestly not sure what to do. Here are what I've been thinking of:


- I've tried picking up the interview/coding books from the dusty bookshelves, but it's overwhelming having to go through algorithms &amp; data structures that I haven't used since the last time I was prepping for interviews, and just the stress from work doesn't help with my lack of motivation to study or do anything related to programming.
- They recently modified our title hierarchy and made a engineer II role and I've considered taking a demotion in hopes that I could actually go back to doing heads-down coding and the company finding a replacement lead.
- I lack the work/life balance and this has not been any better with permanent remote work + living alone, so work is basically my life. Would picking up a new hobby or going through with adopting a pet (I've been considering this for years even before covid) help destress?

I guess I don't necessarily have an answer or reply I'm looking for, but I was just curious as to how many people out there are in a similar situation and how they're handling it or if they're not in a similar situation, what sort of suggestions they have. And a general question for those who end up reading this -- do you guys code/work on projects outside of work?

&lt;p&gt;But then due to having lost our team leads, I was given &lt;strong&gt;even more&lt;/strong&gt; responsibilities (managing &amp;amp; leading projects) , and that landed me in a senior position on my second year (note: this company also overinflates titles/roles so I&amp;#39;m more of a engineer II at best). Now fast forward a whole year -- I find myself spending 95% of my day delegating/researching or designing/doing the grunt work that the previous team lead would have done, and the other 5% of my day is maybe filled with actual coding work. I&amp;#39;m not sure that there is a plan to find a replacement for the lead role, and I&amp;#39;m not comfortable with even attempting the position because I know I still don&amp;#39;t have the fundamental technical skillset down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more, I&amp;#39;ve been finding myself unhappy and resentful with my current role vs responsibilities and I have so much going on in my mind that I&amp;#39;m honestly not sure what to do. Here are what I&amp;#39;ve been thinking of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried picking up the interview/coding books from the dusty bookshelves, but it&amp;#39;s overwhelming having to go through algorithms &amp;amp; data structures that I haven&amp;#39;t used since the last time I was prepping for interviews, and just the stress from work doesn&amp;#39;t help with my lack of motivation to study or do anything related to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They recently modified our title hierarchy and made a engineer II role and I&amp;#39;ve considered taking a demotion in hopes that I could actually go back to doing heads-down coding and the company finding a replacement lead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lack the work/life balance and this has not been any better with permanent remote work + living alone, so work is basically my life. Would picking up a new hobby or going through with adopting a pet (I&amp;#39;ve been considering this for years even before covid) help destress?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I don&amp;#39;t necessarily have an answer or reply I&amp;#39;m looking for, but I was just curious as to how many people out there are in a similar situation and how they&amp;#39;re handling it or if they&amp;#39;re not in a similar situation, what sort of suggestions they have. And a general question for those who end up reading this -- do you guys code/work on projects outside of work? If so how much time do you spend on it per day/week and how do you find the motivation to do it?&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"I am the lead developer on a SaaS product built with Node, TypeScript and Angular. The product needs to be blazingly fast in order to compete and we are a small team. I have made several code optimizations, moved some stuff to background services and generally I am trying to squeeze every bit of performance from database queries. Recently, the marketing team requested an extensive metrics &amp; analytics refactor. Up until now we had been tracking some very basic user actions like Sign Up, Sign In, Plan Upgrades etc but they are now asking for more and more info to be sent over to Segment. They claim that information like that is crucial to product growth but moves like that will definitely go against performance. 

For example, there's an endpoint that allows the batch deletion of posts the user has made that translates into a DELETE FROM table WHERE ids IN (...) raw query. But the event that needs to be tracked requires that we send all columns for every single one of these posts. I don't think it's a good idea to make a SELECT query, sometimes those posts that the user deletes can be hundreds.

The solutions I have though about are the following:

- move event tracking to a background worker (This does not solve the added load on the database which happens to be a low tier db on AWS RDS as we are on a very strict budget)

- move event tracking on the client-side even though I am not sure about the impact on user experience that this is gonna have.

- reject their request for tracking every single user action.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Backstory, I am a senior software engineer for a small software engineering company.  I have been there for 5 years now. 2 months ago I was approached and asked if I would like to be a project manager, I said yes, and then they came back the next month and said I have it.  They also asked me if I would like to cover for our customer relations/sales person position this summer when he goes on leave for about 3 months, which I also agreed to but wanted to know what my compensation would be, aka salary increase.  I also run the summer internship program at our company, basically hire and mentor new interns all summer.

So I asked them for the salary details, job description, training schedule, when do I officially start the position, etc.  Multiple times.  I have basically been given excuses about they need to get details together, etc.

Fast forward to now, I have been in client meetings, manager meetings, they announced my promotion to the other PMs, and been given a plan for which client and project I will be managing but NO SALARY INFO YET.  Although I have not technically started in the position yet.

I have also been moved on to a temporary project as an unofficial tech lead until I officially begin my project management position in about a month.  Which also should command a higher pay.

So I really didnt want all this extra responsibility if the salary increase wasnt worth it.  But I feel like I have basically said yes, thinking I would get the salary info up front but havnt received it yet, and they are saying they will give me my full ""promotion report"" next month.

So does anyone know what kind of salary I should expect?   Should I ask for extra for filling in for the sales position during the summer?  The sales position now does not include any commission and is salary based.  Also is this normal to get a promotion then the company be like, I'll get back with you on that, and slowly, randomly start to roll you on?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi Guys,

I need advice and ideas about standby software development resource.  Our situation is we run a very small software company that provides SaaS products to the travel industry.  I have done all the development and will continue to do all the development in the future.  Lately as we have been getting more larger clients we have been asked about backup.  Normally the question involves a bus ""If you are hit by a bus who is going to manage the system and fix problems?""  (not sure why they always use a bus).  We don't have the income to hire someone and I don't want to give up the programming either.

What are the solutions to this type of issue?  Has anyone else face this problem?  I have done some research into outsourced development but they tend to want you to buy certain amount of hours per month.  What I really need it someone on retainer that can fix/dev when needed.

Any advice is welcome.

cheers

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi everyone,

*Please remove is not suitable for this sub.*

I am aware that this is more a beginner question but it seemed related to software engineering for me. Maybe one of you kind souls can give me some hints.

So I trained a few models to classify text to a large number of categories (&gt;300). My training data was quite small and the number of labels quite large. Hence the performance is not very reliable.

However, I want to use those models to pre-annotate new documents. I already used [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build a simple app that allows user to upload a document/input text and return the predictions.  
Now I would like to build an app that does pretty much the same but allows the user to **correct** the predictions and thus generate new gold-standard data. The app should then store the uploaded document/inputted text and all corrected labels.  
I wish to share this with colleagues so they can more easily annotate data and I can more easily obtain a larger training dataset.

I have almost no experience in software engineering and building applications, so I wonder how I would start with something like this? Could you maybe guide me to the tools I need to learn/employ for this (FastAPI, postgresql?) Preferably in Python. Or perhaps someone can show me a nice tutorial/github repo that is showcasing such a project?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi everyone

Im currently the only senior software engineer at a private company. Im under tremendous stress at work atm. Different departments in the company continuously put new projects on my desk and we’re (I’m) drowning in technical debt.

,SoftwareEngineering," I know that sounds confusing. I'm working on a full-stack web application for my senior project class and in the business layer managers I have an issue where I want to be able to validate that business rules are being followed and return something to the api controller to indicate whether or not that violation has occurred. However, I also want to be able to return what the issue was if the violation did occur, and if it didn't, I want to be able to return the desired result (for example returning a user account object). In addition, I need to ensure I am handling exceptions.

The problem I face is this is a lot to return. At first I over-engineered the solution by returning a tuple where the first value is a simple bool (success or failure) while the second is an object of a custom class called Result, which contains within it a business rule violation message (ex. username exists) and a result, with either being used when applicable. Upon review, my professor was not a fan, thought it was way too complicated and not readable at all. So I refactored it to just return a Result object that encapsulates all three values. He was still not a fan, thought it was more readable and less complicated, but still not very maintainable because it's combining the evaluation of the data along with the raw data, and I might have to constantly update the enum of potential violation messages as business rules expand or change.

He suggested I look at how things are done with HTTP Status Codes and come up with a similar system that categorizes the type of violation, encapsulating both business rule violations and system errors, while passing along the raw data, but let a higher layer determine what that means, ""business-wise"".

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello,

I am building an application that records some IoT device samples. I thought to start I would use postgres because it supports SQL, which could be useful for analyzing our data for relationships with other data our customer collects. it seems like it might be pretty easy to create a few tables and go from there.

however some people have pointed out this data may be more appropriate in a database like elasticsearch or mongo, so we can scale horizontally. we store our relational data in postgres, our sensor samples timeseries in elastic, and our sensor settings and metadata in mongo. then if we need to do a join we just do it in the application layer. my only worry is none of us have experience with mongo or elastic and we're deploying to an on prem environment, and it might be a little tricky to manage at first at least.

it might make design a bit easier though because we could just build our microservices around these persistence layers. so another consideration I suppose.

I am building a cross-platform app using a sack of potatoes from 2011 as a PC. When i use my PC from 2007 the app runs much slower, as expected.

When I run my app on Windows using VC++ i get a nearly twice as much performance than using clang on Linux, using similar compiler optimization flags and exactly the same source code.

So, my question is: 

my app will potentially be used across a number of platforms (Linux, Win, BSD, Mac) and in so many different machines (high-end modern ones, low-end old ones). How can I make sure that the performance is similar in most cases?

I know i need to follow a sort of low common denominator (FPS) for that, but i wonder how you guys do it?

Any advice?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Background: I've just spent my first real year working in a professional software engineering environment. In my time at this very well known corporation, Ive worked on two projects. In both of which seemed like most if not all of the stress came from lower tier managers such as our product managers and product owners, either not properly writing stories or not leaving room for flexibility when unknown circumstances muck up a sprint. Many a time this has led to me having to work 60+ hour weeks cover up their poor planning in order to meet production release deadlines. 

Until recently I kind of just thought this was the norm for software development, but I'm getting more and more frustrated with how these lower tier managers seem to be constantly screwing the pooch. 

What really pissed me off was after working essentially 90 hours straight and taking my weekend to finish a poorly elaborated story, feeling burnout I asked my amazing and understanding big boss dev manager if I could take a day off to mentally recover. He was super understanding and told me to take as much time as I needed to clear my head. But my Product Owner/ Scrum Master pm'd later that day after I got the go ahead and tried to guilt trip me into not taking the day off saying, 

""I hope you taking the day off wont negatively effect our deliverables for this sprint :(""

If me, as a MID LEVEL software engineer, taking a mental day throws THAT much of a wrench into things, something has to be wrong. 

Anyways, this was just me ranting about my work problems, so does anybody have any advice with how to deal with people like this? Any books or articles I could read or just general advice for these kinds of situations would be greatly appreciated!

A  little bit of background on me. I'm a UX Designer and Front-end developer by trade, now focusing more on leading agile teams to build successful products. 

I have a  pretty simple couple of questions I'd like to ask in the hope of gaining  more insights in the area of software estimations and how teams across  the industry are conducting them: 

1. Do you estimate software for work or your customers? If so, how often does it happen? (Per iteration, per milestone, per ticket, etc) 
2. Who is part of the estimation process? Is it performed through synchronous channels (In-person, zoom, etc)? 
3. Does your company have tools or certain methods available to help your development teams estimate? 
4. Other than not being accurate, what is your biggest pain point with estimating?

I turned to Reddit because I'm kinda freaking out because of this sudden role change. 

What I'm freaking out about is not on the technical side of the role but more on the responsibility side. I'm used to waking up, checking tasks/tickets assigned to me, implement them, and that's it. My responsibilities rarely went beyond that. 

But now, I will be responsible for creating tickets, estimating development time, assigning tickets (thankfully, there will be 1 replacement), answering inquiries from stakeholders/counterparts, partly signing off releases for production, creating weekly reports, deciding on what technology to use for certain features, etc. 

I'm used to having a senior that will check my work but now I'm that guy. Now, I have the last say. And when something goes wrong, it's on me. I'm up for the challenges of this new role but it just feels heavy thinking one stupid mistake could cost the company real money in the real world. Reality is starting to sink in.....

,SoftwareEngineering,"I suspect that my organization has a problem when it comes to business analysis and requirements gathering etc which made me think about how these things relate to software engineering, architecture, UX design etc. I suspect this issue probably occurs in many companies and I'm wondering if it's something others recognize or have a remedy for. Here's what typically happens:

Some kind of issue is raised and reaches a product owner who quickly and with little thought comes up with some idea to solve it. The PO then asks engineering to implement it, often with very little or no requirements and use cases. We deal with very abstract concepts that are not easy to reason about intuitively so usually no one can define what exactly it is they want. 

When engineering investigates their extremely vague requirements we sometimes realize that it will not solve the problem they want to solve, but we still have to commit to their specific solution. The discovery process is pretty silo'd, so there's no real dialogue between product owners and engineering. I feel that this leads to unrealistic goals and expectations and sometimes we set out on the wrong path entirely without any ability to change course. Sometimes we build things that are according to the vague spec we have but that no one wants to use and that do not solve any actual business problems.

How can we improve this? I feel that the answer is more emphasis on something like a combination of UX design, business analysis and requirements gathering. We should investigate the business domain, who are the stakeholders, what are the concepts they are dealing with, what is their significance in different business processes, how can we improve the way our users interact with them in various processes etc. Then look at different solutions to fit that into the rest of our software ecosystem and pick one that is viable that achieves the desired effect. 

Is there a name for such a process? I've looked briefly at some business analysis frameworks like 5 Whys, MoSCoW etc, and I feel that they partially cover what I'm talking about, but not the full spectrum. I'm unsure about the transition between that kind of high level business analysis into something more like domain driven design, software architecture, UX design, concrete requirements gathering etc. Basically I'm looking to find the intersection of business analysis and engineering, or if BA *is* engineering, or if there should be no intersection.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I'm a software engineer myself and every time I'm on the job market for a new role I feel that the process of connecting candidates with their next employer is so badly organised.

Now I’m trying to design a marketplace which will allow software developers to find the most relevant job with much less stress and distractions. Please help me identify flaws in my assumptions, based on which I built the first version of the marketplace.

Scope:

1. We focusing on not-entry-level job market, where developers looking for more something specific which aligned with their career vision
2. We are limiting scope to permanent employment only, not freelancing or contracting - there are different rules and forces applied
3. We want to deliver best possible experience for developers when every single serious project in this sphere serving “guys who actually will pay for this” - recruiters and/or employers
4. Now we starting in UK only (our “home job market”) and ready to roll out to USA once functionality will be polished in response to first users feedback
5. We've heard many opinions that recruitment agencies due to severe competition very often use tactics which harm the overall job market atmosphere (manipulating candidates, ripping employers,  etc.). But we believe that recruiters are still important part of the market - so we need to establish for them firm rules which will retain them from using irresponsible tactics and help them deliver their part of the job properly

Assumptions:

1. Every software engineer needs to jump to a different role regularly - in average every couple of years. Sometimes it could happen inside the same company, but mostly the best opportunity comes “from outside”. There are many good reasons for that and both employers and employees benefit from such “rotations”. Developers could move to technologies they love, enrich their experience in building/improving different kinds of projects, try different roles inside projects, etc.
2. Developer could need to monitor the market for a fairly long time until he will find a project which is relevant to his ambitions and plans. First, not every project suits my needs, secondly I will not satisfy every project which I’ll find interesting for me. Practically, you can start looking at the market after the first half a year from starting your new job. Often during your “coming out to the job market” you understand that your current job is the best option for you for a time being. Or you’ll find how you need to improve your skills to be successful next time.
3. Developer should not expose his identity to the entire market since until he finds a good option he is not leaving the current company. Exposure of your interest to explore your options could be misunderstood by your current employer.
4. Developer should build a simple profile where described:
   1. skills - technology, level of expertise and duration of usage
   2. anonymous cover letter - clearly answering a questions “what I’m capable of and what I’m looking for”
   3. expected salary level
   4. *Developer’s profile should be eloquent enough to help recruiter understand if candidate suits employer’s expectations and preferences*
5. Recruiters will be able to search relevant candidates by skills / salary level, assess by their cover letter and if they are relevant, approach them with a full job/project description, salary range and hiring company name.
   1. *We believe that information about the project should be detailed and honest enough to get interest from relevant candidates - badly designed (vague, incomplete, without salary range) descriptions should not be allowed at all*
6. When a developer sees such invitation to consider the position/project he can:
   1. decline it with one click “not interested for me”
   2. Apply for this job by revealing his full contacts and CV - again with one click

&lt;p&gt;Since I build webapps for a living and like so many others I use cookies for securely exchanging tokens, I just want to make sure that this won&amp;#39;t be an issue going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, Im probably worrying for nothing. If google broke authentication cookies they would break a large part of the web, and they won&amp;#39;t be doing that. However, that doesn&amp;#39;t mean there may not still be some kind of technical changes on the way affecting cookies that I should be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

Some background, I've been a professional developer for over 6 years now and recently within that time period completed my major in Software Engineering from a major university. I spent a lot of time studying and working full time, but I honestly feel like Software Engineering was an awful choice and even though I really like algorithms, system design, and programming, I hated half of what I was doing. Which just stroke me as peculiar, because I like software. I like writing software, designing software, and seeing it work.

Some classes, such as algorithms, operating systems, etc. that were fairly ""challenging"" I actually found I rather enjoyed them. But for some reason the other half of my classes were filled with ""Software Engineering"" type of work, which happens to be filled with buzzwords like ""structured"" or ""disciplined"" ways of creating software. The upshot was that this normally included memorizing a list of design patterns from a once famous book (Go4 ring any bells?) that's spoken with some holy reverence, the endless forms of UML diagramming and its syntax, or some crazy self-reporting document that's used to track your performance with a word document that's for some reason still a .doc and isn't compatible with newer versions of Word.

* Minimal exposure to programming languages other than Java or python
* Version control techniques of any kind, no introduction to git, or any other kinds of version control type of things, *which is odd considering this is about software design*
* Actually interesting and relevant topics such as compilers, file systems, or virtualization/containerization, security or cryptography, or hardware

All of these had to get passed up so I can identify the syntax errors in an operational pattern? It's honestly one of the biggest farces I've ever seen.

,SoftwareEngineering,"For starters, my background mostly involves building back-end Java services. I have been thinking of ideas for a personal project to learn a new technology. I'd like to learn more about machine learning and thought of an idea to get started. 

I am a bit of a weightlifting enthusiast, as such, a weight/rep calculator can be a useful tool. The issue with these is they are completely static. You enter in a weight/rep (100x1 would mean i can lift 100lbs a single time) and it would then calculate whatever weight is suggested if I want to do 5 reps. I was thinking of a way to improve this using machine learning. Essentially I would have an app that I enter in my current 1 rep max for a given movement and it would output a suggested weight given the number of reps I want to do. To add to this, I wanted to allow the user to give feedback after using said rep scheme. Say they enter in a value from 1-10 on how easy it was to complete at the given weight, at which point the model can adjust.

The issue here is everything I've read thus far involves training data. In my example, the training data is supplied by the user and unique to the individual. Is my idea feasible? I am wanting to create an iOS app, and from what I understand Apple provides a useful library called Core ML.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi folks,

I'm looking for a method to upgrade/downgrade a python application. Git is not enough, it requires some manual migration between versions.

**Example changelog:**

    0.0.1 Init
0.0.2 Rename directory
0.0.3 Modify database structure
0.0.4 ...

I'd like to **upgrade/downgrade between all versions**. E.g. from 0.0.1 to 0.0.4 or from 0.0.4 to 0.0.2.

My current idea is to write a **patch file for each version**, containing two opposing functions:

    # patch_0-0-2.py
    
    def upgrade():
        # rename directory from A to B
    
    def downgrade():
        # rename directory from B to A

Furthermore I need to map the compatibilities. E.g. 0.0.3 isn't backwards compatible, etc.

Is there a common best practice or maybe even a production ready framework?

It was probably re-invented hundreds of times, but I'm missing the right terms to find what I'm looking for. Any guidance is appreciated.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I do academic research for a living, and I am so far from a software engineer that it's laughable. But my job requires that I constantly download and make sweet love to PDFs. The problem with PDF's is that I can't mess with the metadata like a God, and other file managers I am aware of are awful, so I want to build my own file explorer that allows me to assign 'pseudo-metadata' to a file within the explorer so I can organize my files how I want to.

So for example I could add a pseudo-metadata field to the file explorer like 'Field' or 'Sub-Field' or 'Methodology', and then assign to the PDF some text. The metadata would not exist outside of my little program though, it would just be for me.

I have some programming experience in Python, but to do this I feel like I will need other languages and a lot of advice from Stackexchange, but maybe not, I don't know. Below is an on-going list of the ideas and languages that I suspect I would need to learn, but basically I'm starting from ground zero in software design so any advice/resources/languages to build this thing would be great.

Core Features of the File Explorer Idea:

1. Able to read and open files from the existing File Explorer in Windows 10
2. Assign some form of pseudo-meta data within the software program
3. ...
4. ...

On Going List of Languages To Do This Project:

1. CSS --&gt; So that the file explorer has some degree of style to it.
2. Python --&gt;

Seems to me that everyone is using the same method when doing root cause analysis (on dev/staging/prod envs), Plugging it all to some ELK, Using Kiali/Other tool for specific MS log trailing.

This is of course when you even have a stack trace that gives you more info, what if it is some authorization issue between services or some other DevOps tools in the stack (istio etc.)

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi everyone,

In our latest podcast episode, we had an interesting discussion with Gergely Hodicska (VP of Engineering at Bitrise) about the importance of soft skills in tech leadership.

He honestly shared his shortcomings and main learnings on becoming an engineering leader. His takeaways could help many of you so I thought to share some highlights here.

**1. Take feedback**

This is the best way to know you’re doing something wrong. Take all the feedback you can get, and consider them carefully. Some may be way off, but you can find some weaknesses by paying attention.

**2. Work on your self-awareness**

Your biggest enemy is your autopilot. Your defense mechanisms tend to kick in way too early, and they get in the way of cooperation. Becoming more self-aware helps you master your instincts and salvage situations that may spiral out of control.

**3. Invest in yourself**

There are many different ways for you to improve your leadership soft skills. Some are free, others cost money, but they all cost time and energy. Invest that in your soft skills to improve your professional and personal life as well.

**4. Help others in your organization**

Improving leadership skills on every level of your company will certainly pay off. You can use your one-on-one meetings to coach and mentor your direct reports so they sharpen up their leadership soft skills as well.

&amp;#x200B;

,SoftwareEngineering,"WARNING - contains trace elements of feelings. may not be purely technology related

I worked for a long time for a single bank in various roles as a java developer. There weren't many notable things I did (normal java dev stuff), except for helping to implement the backed for fingerprint and facial recognition (third party provider) which I enjoyed immensely. I got involved in rewriting the customer information systems serving as technical team lead for two teams as well as part designer/architect of the system.  I had been in the team from the start so I knew the systems intimately and knew the company very well. You could call me tenured. 

So I'm in my forties and I realise that I'm drifting further away from technical work, and into management which I don't like. At the same time the work is no longer challenging and I fear I am losing my technical skills (we haven't worked with things like Spring, Github, Slack, containerisation like docker, kubernetes or cloud providers like AWS or done any really reactive java or functional programming) and doing tutorials and training without on the job experience only takes you so far. So I decided to jump ship and work for another company in another field in another country. At the company is a java developer which I have worked with before. He is good. REALLY good and I take this as an opportunity to up-skill with someone I know is good. Having a masters in software engineering  and loads of experience I get the job fairly easily.

Everything is new, there are technologies and concepts I have never used or seen. And the team I am placed in is the cream of the crop. They are a small team of the-best-of-the-best. And they have to be, as their work is the backbone of the company. They churn out quality code that attracts very little if any comments and questions. Their grasp of technology and the domain is unparalleled.

Its been a year now and I feel like an anchor. Whenever I submit PR's I get thousands of comments for various things I either did not consider, or did not understand. I hardly speak up in technical discussions anymore. I get anxious whenever I have to submit my code. Doing standby duties on the rotation has me stressing for a week hoping nothing major happens. I have taken on as much of the non technical duties in the team as I can (like being the scrum master and handling presentations) so I can at least be of some use.  I thought for a while that maybe I suffer from impostor syndrome, but these days I'm really starting to think that maybe I'm just that bad.

I feel like I have become that clueless developer that I have always loathed, that does not understand the domain or the technology and takes forever to do simple things. Honestly, if I was layed of now I wouldn't even be surprised (It would cause all sorts of VISA issues as I'm the sole provider a.t.m).  
Looking back over the last year , where I use to churn out lots of code and implement all kinds of designs in my previous job, I haven't really had the opportunity to code as much as I wanted to, or work as much with the technologies that are in use here. Since I started at the new company  I have hardly done any java coding and I seem to do only System analysis on existing implementations (we are rewriting a core part the system) and documentation. From the sound of it it wasn't always like that though.

No one has talked to me about a lack of performance. Maybe they are too polite and I'm just barely good enough. Mediocre . I've considered talking to our line manager about this, but fear I may cause more problems than its worth. Same with talking to the team about it. So I'm stuck in some sort of mental limbo where I'm not happy, but because I feel my work is not good enough, I don't feel justified to not be. Questions I have thought about, do I try and move to another team? Another company? If I'm not good enough here, will I be ""not good enough"" elsewhere?

Should this rant event be in the section, maybe there are other out there who are in the same situation, or was and have done something. What was that something?

,SoftwareEngineering,"**My background:** I am a software developer and have been for about 3 years now. I had some hobby experience programming before I went to college for it. Since graduating I've had three developer roles at three different companies; currently employed at my third one.

**What is the point of this post?:** I'm not entirely sure. I'm not even looking for advice (Reddit gives pretty lazy, copy-paste advice anyway). I guess I just want to know if anyone shares my experience or what it's like at other companies.

**My problem:** Now, before I start pointing the finger elsewhere, let's establish *my* personal issues. I have a monstrous time paying attention in meetings and always have. So, there is a big issue with me and trying to digest business requirements in sprint planning/refinement meetings.

**INB4** ""It sounds like u have ADHD! U should try therapy/meditation/medication!""

I have tried all of those things. Therapy was a waste of my time (""u just haven't found the rite one!""), meditation *maybe* helped in the long run to a questionable extent, and I had such a bad reaction to the medication that it's not even worth the risk to try a different one. In short, this is not a problem that has a feasible solution.

Now, all that being said, it seems that my teammates also have a difficult time interpreting business requirements, because to be fair, they are often short, vague, and full of language that sounds like it came out of a meetings that was about 5 degrees removed from when it's finally introduced to the devs.

**INB4**: ""just ask 4 clarity!""

Well, with me there's a very fine line I ride. I've learned from experience that asking for clarity can catch me a lot of heat because *apparently*, it's information that's already been discussed and therefore information I should not be asking for. Well, fair enough. We've already been over my attention issue, but that doesn't help me, because I still need to know the requirements. The seniors also discourage asking questions after the sprint planning meetings ""because if you have a question it needs to be asked during the sprint planning."" Maybe that's how most people feel, I'm not sure, but I don't think I agree with that philosophy. There are many times when the devs have to change requirements mid-sprint because there was an implementation problem that couldn't have possibly been known at the time of the meeting. I don't think it's reasonable to assume that every question that could possibly be answered can be answered in the span of a few minutes, especially if you're like me and need some time to digest the info after it's been presented. I could go on with my gripes about that, but you get the picture.

**INB4**: ""ur bosses r dicks! Just get another job bro!""

Trust me, I intend to. Unfortunately, I just don't know what it's going to be. It's clear to me I'm not cut out to be a dev, and that's heart breaking. Not because I'm in love with SE (far from it), but because after all my effort, and after watching everyone else I know who's tried it succeed, I'm the only one who's fallen flat on my face no matter how hard I've tried. And that's the point I really want to emphasize here: *I tried*. I've gone through the cycle of hope and despair too many times now. Every time I put in more work to really try to get a grasp on what's going on, it all comes crashing down in an instant when my boss coldly just tells me ""it's all wrong. That's not what I wanted."" We can call him a dick who needs to be more clear, but in the end, the other devs don't get told that like I do. In the end, it's *my* problem. And naturally, I'm pretty worried about all that wasted effort not only ending my career, but landing me back in poverty. Again, I'm not asking for advice here, just voicing my concerns I guess.

,SoftwareEngineering,"It is common to hear people in our industry refer to ""Software Projects"" or ""Software Products"" interchangeably. However, as a product person I've been trying to highlight some key non-trivial differences between the two models, specially in mindset.

Recently, I read this spot on article on the topic: [Software Projects vs Software Products](https://www.romenrg.com/blog/2020/12/30/software-projects-vs-software-products/); in which some of these subtle -yet critical- implications when choosing one word over the other are described in detail.

Besides the time constraints that the concept of ""project"" implies *(i.e. a project must have a defined end date)* and the evolving nature of ""products""; some ramifications of the differences also include the different rewards for technical quality; the skills that are more relevant in one case vs the other; and also which mindset fits better each model.

I'm curious to know with how many of you this differentiation resonates. I see ""Products"" tightly linked to Software Engineering, and in particular to the pursuit of technical excellence and value delivery (by means of iterative and incremental approaches, i.e. Agile Software Development, Lean, etc.), so it feels to me the industry should probably be moving towards that direction, thinking in terms of products more often than in terms of projects.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello there,

Some friends and I have decided to develop an app (a very simple one) which will get some inforamtion from different API's and display and sort it according to the user. The coding issues aren't really a problem right now. 

What I was hoping to get help with is this:

The challenge is to make the app cross-platform i.e. web, iOS and Android. Since everybody on the team is inexperienced we were wondering which frameworks are possible and would work for such an application. It would be nice if the frontend could be reused across all platforms (such as React native) and the backend would need to be able to run jobs at specified time intervals. It would also be very nice if the technology/framework is friendly for newbies (we all know how to code etc, we just haven't developed an actual complex app yet).

&amp;#x200B;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey everyone,

Probably most of us are working remotely and for some companies, remote work remains the default. Shopify is one of these companies that will remain remote after the pandemic.

Working remotely requires a different approach to work and communication. Also, the onboarding process of new team members will be different, generating new challenges.

Jerie Shaw explains  Shopify's remote onboarding process, and how they've developed it to become more effective than in-person onboarding.

I'm highlighting three key takeaways from the interview, but you can discover more knowledge nuggets in the full interview. 

Also,  please feel free to share your experience with onboarding new team members remotely.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Social isolation**

People are sitting at home all day working, so you can’t bet on their forming bonds getting them past the early days in the company. You need to manage energy levels, create opportunities for bonding, and make onboarding useful.

**2. Make it flexible**

Make your onboarding process modular, so you can keep iterating in small increments. Just like microservices.

Different time zones also require flexibility. Make sure to provide opportunities for facilitated and individual learning whenever possible.

**3. Make it active, synchronous, and hybrid**

This is where the magic happens. Adjusting to time zones will make your process hybrid.

You can make it active by giving them real tasks to do and synchronous by providing tools like a virtual pod and available experts of their area.

There is a lot more to remote onboarding and especially to this last point. Do you want to take a deep dive?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi there! 

I have been working for some time on a project with a microservices architecture where each service has its own environment variables which are handled with a `.env` file for each service/repository. 

A great part of these variables are related to other services IPs and external resources keys which are different in each environment: Development, Staging, and Production so the `.env` is not a simple one.

Our development pace is fast and most of the time these variables change with new features and or changes implemented by teammates working on issues related to that service. This causes that almost every time others want to work with a service they get blocked and have to update the `.env` file before. Therefore we end up requesting and sharing `.env` files with each other all the time and there is a lack of a ""Source of truth"" for all the `.env` files.

I was wondering if someone else has had this problem or a similar one before and what approaches has followed to solve it or improve it. 

Is there any application or framework for sharing and managing `.env` files in a team in an automated way?

Thanks in advance!

EDIT

Just to be clear, these are not being added to source control and they are properly handled on CI/CD.

I was talking more about local development, setting up services locally, and keeping the `.env` local files up to date in an easy way.

&lt;p&gt;I have been working for some time on a project with a microservices architecture where each service has its own environment variables which are handled with a &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file for each service/repository. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great part of these variables are related to other services IPs and external resources keys which are different in each environment: Development, Staging, and Production so the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; is not a simple one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our development pace is fast and most of the time these variables change with new features and or changes implemented by teammates working on issues related to that service. This causes that almost every time others want to work with a service they get blocked and have to update the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file before. Therefore we end up requesting and sharing &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; files with each other all the time and there is a lack of a &amp;quot;Source of truth&amp;quot; for all the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if someone else has had this problem or a similar one before and what approaches has followed to solve it or improve it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any application or framework for sharing and managing &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; files in a team in an automated way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to be clear, these are not being added to source control and they are properly handled on CI/CD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was talking more about local development, setting up services locally, and keeping the &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; local files up to date in an easy way.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"I'm currently looking into strategies for storing historical data for ""as-of"" types of queries.  Since we use SQL Server, I've so far found the following three main ones:

,SoftwareEngineering,"I'm currently the sole developer on an internal company annotation platform.  


&gt;For those who don't know what that is it's a paint like platform, where users draw around and label their drawings, like e.g. a picture of a dog in the forest - the user draws a polygon around the dog and labels it ""dog"".

Currently, the annotaters are able to use one of a list of predefined labels to annotate images. These labels are flat, meaning, the admin creates one label and the user uses one label.  
Now, however, if the administrator wants to add a hierarchy to the labels, e.g. first color, second animal, last race then the admin has to create long annoying labels like ""brown\_dog\_labrador"" or ""black\_dog\_husky"". It's obvious that this will end in a endless list with (likely) duplicates, decreased productivity and overview.

I looked at some other annotation tools, but most of them also use flat labels.

**One idea i had** is to use tags. There are three levels of tags. Colors would belong to level 1. Animal level 2 and race level 3.

Now, when a user needs to label the dog, they click on these tags, seperated in three containers. Then they would end up having the tags ""brown"", ""dog"", ""labrador"" - which combined result in the label.

I have an idea to ""batch log"" to reduce the overhead — in a program with a simple request/response model (e.g. a rest api), only write to disk once per request/response cycle, where the write-entry contains multiple logging messages which were called at different places throughout the program.

```
// data access layer
logger.info('inserted user row into user table')

// external api service
logger.info('created user identity in auth provider')

// service layer
logger.info('created user')
logger.info('created auth identity')

// http endpoint layer
logger.info('registered user')
logger.flush() // the write to i/o occurs here, containing all the above messages

- reduce i/o calls for better perf

,SoftwareEngineering,"I work at a large company as a software engineer who is working primarily as an analyst who specializes in optimization and security. On a daily basis, I generally need to look at a totally unfamiliar library or codebase, sometimes which is poorly or not documented at all, and examine code to find, analyze, and sometimes patch bugs. This means that literally every day, I am trying to figure out what it is I am looking at and sometimes be supposed to aid the main developer of the code in solving a problem with his/her/their own code. This of course is without them walking me through any of it.

While it's certainly doable, I've found it quite stressful and I often feel imposter syndrome, not because I can't code, but because I'm always looking at code that I'm unfamiliar with. This is in contrast to say, being a dev working on 1-5 codebases for months or years. What tends to happen is that it takes me a lot longer (and requires more mental energy) to get to the bottom of a bug simply because most of the time I'm trying to figure out ""What does this code even do?"" ""Who uses it?"" ""How is it used?"", ""Will this routine ever be provided an invalid integer?"" and so on. Yes, I can often find docs, but doing a new code base or 5 daily wears on me. Also, docs are only usually for API and I also have to work on internal/opaque functionality. I feel I would be much more skilled at each individual task if they were in a codebase I had several years of experience working with.

So I wanted to ask: How important do you other engineers feel knowing a codebase is when it comes to your ability to effectively work with it? When you joined the team, how long did it take?

,SoftwareEngineering,"I'm working on application where the complexity lies in the business logic (versus scale of data, realtime, etc).  That being said, when something happens in the system, other teams will often ask the engineering team, ""Why did this happen?  I thought X would have happened?"".  Sometimes the code needs to be improved and sometimes not, but regardless the system should be easier to interpret by anyone (product, support, account managers, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any techniques/libraries/patterns to recommend making a system easier to audit/interpret?

&amp;#x200B;

# Example

**Business Logic:** To get a job at a restaurant you need to be either 16 years old or have a workers permit.

**Transactional:** When someone applies, if they don't meet the criteria, automatically fail them.

**Search:** When a manager does a candidate search, only return people which meet the above criteria.

Both types of interactions need similar but have slightly different interpretability questions:

1. Person X applied and failed.  Why did they fail?
2. I did a search and Person X wasn't in the list, but I think they should be.  Why weren't they?

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 has a naive solution - put logging/audit-trail statements all over your code, potentially updating the database with the result.  While this works, I'm afraid it'll instantly turn to spaghetti and still be hard for non-engineers to sift through and interpret.

\#2 - I'm not even sure the best way to represent ""here is why the person you are looking for was not returned in this SQL query (or SQL queries intermixed w/ application code)"".

&amp;#x200B;

Note: The real examples are more complex than what is shown above, but hopefully it illustrates my question.  :)

I recently started moonlighting as a consultant for a company that pretty much fixes code that is falling apart in the 11th hour. I've only been on a few projects so far but I'm starting to notice what I think is a trend of overengineering.

,SoftwareEngineering,"What are some of your software engineering pet peeves?  I mean, things that annoy you that you constantly are encountering and having to deal with.  Here are some of mine that are killing some of my enthusiasm for work:

* People insisting on reusing existing database tables for data unrelated to what the table had originally been created for.  I don't know how many times I've heard it suggested to just put data in some table and then fill in non-applicable columns with random garbage ""placeholders"" just to satisfy constraints.  Then we wind up having to have overly complicated, and sometimes buggy, logic to try to untangle this data to try to figure out what it is representing.  I don't care if there are a few columns in the table that are already the data type we need and have column names that are somewhat similar to what we need to store -- if the data is unrelated, why can't we simply create a new table for it and keep things simpler to deal with?  It especially makes it confusing for new developers because the table/column comments and names are deceptive -- the data is not what these things say they are.
* Related to above, filling a database table with effectively duplicate records when a many-to-many relationship should have been used.  Part of the reason this occurs is because, as mentioned above, the table had not originally been designed to need a many-to-many relationship but because of reusing the table for something else that had different data requirements, we now have these duplicates.  Also, now that the table deliberately has duplicates, it no longer has unique constraints on identifiers because there are multiple copies of effectively the same records.
* Whenever I identify a potential problem that may be able to cause bugs or break something, the response I often get back from people is, ""That would never happen.""  It doesn't matter that I could demonstrate the problem in the application with the data needed to cause it to happen, they still insist that it would never happen in production.  I think this annoys me for multiple reasons.  For one, we are constantly dealing with bugs to fix things that we thought ""would never happen"", but also it indicates that the implementation is flawed and something should be done about it.
* People hacking code into strange places just to get their story completed, like they never heard of separation of concerns.  Just because there is a method that already exists that is already being called, doesn't mean you should shove in multiple unrelated operations into the same method.  For example, I was just thinking of one function that was responsible for just finding and returning data from the database but then business logic also got thrown in there because ""it is something that should happen at around the time this function is called"".  I feel classes and methods should have clearly defined purposes and I don't care if shoving some random code somewhere is the ""easiest way"" to implement some functionality.
* Another thing that annoys me is when I'm looking through code for a system our team is responsible for and I find that some other team had added something in without even letting us know about it.  Often, since they don't really have an understanding of this system, how it works, or what its requirements are, it results in some problem that I now need to figure out how to deal with.  This problem is often related to the previous one -- some developer thought it would be the easiest way to implementing something so they just go and make changes without considering the implications of what they're doing.
* Related to the above, developers merging their code in (an senior developers approving pull requests) when they know that it is incomplete or broken because it's approaching the end of the two week sprint and they don't want to go overtime.  What's more important, performance metrics that give a deceptive impression to managers or actually functioning code that isn't going to cause weeks worth of work to correct and clean up after?
* Working with people who have an ""I'm the only one who's allowed to talk"" kind of attitude, so I can't make it through even a single sentence without getting cut off.  It is frustrating when there are important things that I need to say but they don't even want to hear it.  Then weeks later when problems arise they are like, ""Why didn't you say something about this earlier?""  Well, I tried.

Edit: I had thought of another one:

* Developers being too quick to perform low-level manipulations of data in the database.  The codebase has throughout it assumptions about implementation details that the code in question should not be aware of.  Very little seems to be handled through abstractions and interfaces, and instead people just fetch what they need, manipulate it, and store it -- often reimplementing the same sort of functionality in multiple places instead of relying on some implementation of common functionality.  This makes it difficult for the implementation to change in the future because there is so much tied to an exact implementation.  It seems Java streams makes this kind of coding style much easier and more common, because a developer can easily throw in a few lines of code to filter, sort, map, and manipulate the data to get what they want.  Whenever this needs to be done again, effectively the same stream operations wind up reimplemented in the middle of another method instead of being reused.",t2_44prw,False,,0,False,Pet Peeves,[],r/SoftwareEngineering,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_l498w3,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,1611528871.0,,[],{},,True,,1611555883.0,text,6,,,text,self.SoftwareEngineering,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are some of your software engineering pet peeves?

Part of the reason this occurs is because, as mentioned above, the table had not originally been designed to need a many-to-many relationship but because of reusing the table for something else that had different data requirements, we now have these duplicates.  Also, now that the table deliberately has duplicates, it no longer has unique constraints on identifiers because there are multiple copies of effectively the same records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whenever I identify a potential problem that may be able to cause bugs or break something, the response I often get back from people is, &amp;quot;That would never happen.&amp;quot;  It doesn&amp;#39;t matter that I could demonstrate the problem in the application with the data needed to cause it to happen, they still insist that it would never happen in production.  I think this annoys me for multiple reasons.  For one, we are constantly dealing with bugs to fix things that we thought &amp;quot;would never happen&amp;quot;, but also it indicates that the implementation is flawed and something should be done about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People hacking code into strange places just to get their story completed, like they never heard of separation of concerns.  Just because there is a method that already exists that is already being called, doesn&amp;#39;t mean you should shove in multiple unrelated operations into the same method.  For example, I was just thinking of one function that was responsible for just finding and returning data from the database but then business logic also got thrown in there because &amp;quot;it is something that should happen at around the time this function is called&amp;quot;.  I feel classes and methods should have clearly defined purposes and I don&amp;#39;t care if shoving some random code somewhere is the &amp;quot;easiest way&amp;quot; to implement some functionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another thing that annoys me is when I&amp;#39;m looking through code for a system our team is responsible for and I find that some other team had added something in without even letting us know about it.  Often, since they don&amp;#39;t really have an understanding of this system, how it works, or what its requirements are, it results in some problem that I now need to figure out how to deal with.  This problem is often related to the previous one -- some developer thought it would be the easiest way to implementing something so they just go and make changes without considering the implications of what they&amp;#39;re doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Related to the above, developers merging their code in (an senior developers approving pull requests) when they know that it is incomplete or broken because it&amp;#39;s approaching the end of the two week sprint and they don&amp;#39;t want to go overtime.  What&amp;#39;s more important, performance metrics that give a deceptive impression to managers or actually functioning code that isn&amp;#39;t going to cause weeks worth of work to correct and clean up after?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with people who have an &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m the only one who&amp;#39;s allowed to talk&amp;quot; kind of attitude, so I can&amp;#39;t make it through even a single sentence without getting cut off.  It is frustrating when there are important things that I need to say but they don&amp;#39;t even want to hear it.  Then weeks later when problems arise they are like, &amp;quot;Why didn&amp;#39;t you say something about this earlier?&amp;quot;  Well, I tried.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: I had thought of another one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developers being too quick to perform low-level manipulations of data in the database.  The codebase has throughout it assumptions about implementation details that the code in question should not be aware of.  Very little seems to be handled through abstractions and interfaces, and instead people just fetch what they need, manipulate it, and store it -- often reimplementing the same sort of functionality in multiple places instead of relying on some implementation of common functionality.  This makes it difficult for the implementation to change in the future because there is so much tied to an exact implementation.  It seems Java streams makes this kind of coding style much easier and more common, because a developer can easily throw in a few lines of code to filter, sort, map, and manipulate the data to get what they want.  Whenever this needs to be done again, effectively the same stream operations wind up reimplemented in the middle of another method instead of being reused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"I work for a small consultancy that's venturing into 'software development'. We have plenty of experience with data, databases and so on, but developing applications not so much. I'll ask my question with a simple example, to not bore you with vague ramblings:  

We have an online store running where people can subscribe to services. We have a database that contains data that's necessary for these services. We have a piece of client software that enables users to use the service (using the data in the database). These different  parts all run on different, independent systems.  

&amp;#x200B;

We want to connect these. When a subscription is bought or renewed, data relating to that order needs to be stored in the database and some follow-up actions need to be taken by other systems. The client software needs to communicate with the database to check if the user is authorized to use the service and to receive the necessary data. We understand that is good practice to keep the components of a distributed system decoupled and in separate layers (data and business logic, for example). For some parts it is obvious where to place things: data and data processing takes place in the database. But we're unsure about the other parts. The online store software contains some of the business logic, but where do we 'physically' put the part/code that does everything to glue the systems together? Let's assume all these systems can be controlled via REST API's, where would we host the code that does all the calls? And what do you call this type of place/software/platform?  

&amp;#x200B;

I know 'it depends', but I'm looking for the \*'\[...\] but in a lot of cases you would do X'\* answer that follows. And I'm particularly interested in options that abstract away the low level stuff (i.e. we don't need or want to implement our own message queues) to keep the turnaround time fast.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey everyone,

We had an interesting discussion with John Ford (VP of Engineering at LogMeIn) who has decades of leadership experience in tech and he was super kind to share his methods on how to turn around underperforming engineering teams.  


I thought to share some highlights here. **Would love to know if you have any tips or seen any methods working well at your organization.**  


**Some tips from the interview:**

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Assess the team performance**

You may be told that an engineering team underperforms, but in reality, the expectations may be set too high. Keep an open mind as you examine the people, process, and technology aspects of the team.

**2. Realistic velocity goals**

You need to set up proper goals for the team. In software engineering, the correct way is to set up time distribution among different aspects of the work, like feature development, maintenance, security, and support.

**3. The process aspect**

Processes cause more problems than people do. Go through your team’s processes, and look for anything that costs time and effort while providing little to no value. They may have been useful at some point but lost relevance, and it’s up to you to fix them. 

**4. The people aspect**

This is by far the most important and complicated aspect to figure out. You need to assess skills, attitude, and sometimes you have to get people off the team. You also need to support them and leave them space to work. And we’re only scratching the surface…

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a software engineer who's been slowly shifting toward cloud engineering and devops tasks the last year or two and while I've found a lot of great books on distributed design fundamentals and techniques I've struggled to find approachable resources for networking and operating systems.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Just graduated with my bachelors in mathematics. 

To be completely honest I really regret it since I now realize I missed out on a lot of vocational education I would’ve gotten through getting a CS degree. 

I have taken computer science 1, discrete math, programming in VBA (MSforms), and Web Development throughout my curriculum and then a lot of math classes. 

I’m thinking I should find some supplemental education to prepare myself for technical interviews. Thinking about Udemy due to the reasonable price for a lot of the courses. If you guys have any other recommendations that would be great. 

In the next coming months I’m looking to do a crash course in 
• Data Structures &amp; Algorithms 
• Software Architecture 

And are there any other standard courses you guys would recommend so I have all the knowledge to succeed in the role once I get an offer? 

At this point I’m learning python (semi-formally through a course, and by working on a project). 

I’m going to try and create extensive documentation detailing my thought processes for using certain libraries and what I would change in the future. 

Since I am learning python on LinkedIn should I search for jobs as a python developer to get my foot in the door? Or aim for entry level software engineering instead since that is my goal.

It's boring, requires no creative thinking on my part except the few times I was given the freedom to come up with a solution and ended up watching upper management trash it in favor of sticking with their conventional ways because, and I quote, ""do we have a server to run PHP Laravel on? Oh, I don't think we do.""

But it's a massive company and a great addition on my resume. So I might as well get paid for doing the monkey work while learning a new thing or two.

**--- Start of wall of text you can feel free to completely ignore ---**

So I thought about making an online portfolio to showcase past projects.

Then I started updating my resume to compress 6 pages of needless bullshit into 1 sleek page.

And damn, the ""Projects"" area only has 2 projects I can list on it that aren't NDA'd.

But hey, I have this nice idea for a concept project that will have all of these cool frameworks I haven't used before. Oh! Why don't I use the Facebook Graph API too?

And wow, I haven't used React before. Maybe Next.js is a good entry level option! I'll use that for the front-end.

Laravel now couples itself with Docker? Awesome. I've always wanted to get into containerization. I'll learn to use that, so I can publish my concept project as a Docker image.

What's that? I've always wanted to learn to use Kubernetes, I'll leave that for later though.

Maybe I'll use GitHub Actions to build a CI/CD pipeline because we don't have one of those at work and I finally wanna build my own workflow. I'd better learn to write valid YAML!

Inertia.js? I don't even have to do any front-end work? Fuck React, I'll go with that. Better learn to use yet another Laravel package in JetStream.

**--- End of wall of text you've ignored ---**

And here's the thing: what if my next prospective employer doesn't even use Laravel? I was way too comfortable with it before this job, but now I find myself using archaic content publishing platforms, not even development frameworks.

So I will have learned to integrate all of these things together for nothing?

It's all so overwhelming. I've let myself get comfortable with being a mediocre developer performing repetitive tasks at my workplace. Granted, I get paid well for it and I can't afford to get out of it without lining up another job because I have bills to pay.

But how the heck do you navigate this field? This is all just web application development.

What about distributed systems? That seems to be a hot field right now. But I haven't touched C++ since CS101. And cloud? I can't go my entire life just being a ""web developer.""

Now my ""simple portfolio"" is a full-stack app with a complete CI/CD workflow built inside a Docker image with countless libraries underneath, that I haven't fully mastered.

How do people do it? All of this stuff I feel really eager to learn will take me at least a month. That's one month closer to being 24. I feel like I have 5 years before employers will basically toss my resume in the trash when they get it.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello everybody.

I'm in the position of setting up a framework within a company that follows the IEC 62304. IEC 62304 defines the life cycle requirements for medical device software. The set of processes, activities, and tasks described in this standard establishes a common framework for medical device software life cycle processes.

Such processes are software development planning, Software requirements analysis, Software architectural design, and so on and forth.

I was wondering if anyone else had such an experience and if there are any tools out there that can help you build such a framework. The IEC 62304 talks to you about what it needs but it provides no templates/tools. I think a system that is based on Word documents is not that agile and versatile.

Thanks in advance.",t2_fim7j,False,,0,False,What is your experience with IEC 62304 for medical device software?,[],r/SoftwareEngineering,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_kzuf3q,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1611004401.0,text,6,,,text,self.SoftwareEngineering,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m in the position of setting up a framework within a company that follows the IEC 62304. IEC 62304 defines the life cycle requirements for medical device software. The set of processes, activities, and tasks described in this standard establishes a common framework for medical device software life cycle processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such processes are software development planning, Software requirements analysis, Software architectural design, and so on and forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if anyone else had such an experience and if there are any tools out there that can help you build such a framework. The IEC 62304 talks to you about what it needs but it provides no templates/tools. I think a system that is based on Word documents is not that agile and versatile.&lt;/p&gt;

I might just say fuck it and go with styled-components because I tend to overthink what people say, but my anxiety is forcing me to ask for a second opinion so here I am.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi guys,

Just wanted to understand if others feel the same way about team participation as I do. I always feel I'm the only one of my team who will voluntarily do work that needs to be done. Everyone else just seems to wait until someone else tells them to do it. I feel it's rare when I see someone proactively getting things done without being told or coaxed. This usually elevates me to team lead. 

So, would everyone say its pretty normal to only have 1 out of say 5 sw engineers be proactive? Am I just not seeing when other's participate? Am I trying to bite off more than I can chew?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello, real quick, my name is Matt, I’m 27, and I’m looking to make a major career change. 

Short extremely boiled down version of my life.

Hardly graduated highschool, grew up in a very unstable household, focusing on myself and studies was virtually impossible-I basically just treaded water and survived trying to avoid everyone and everything-the craziness.

Fast forward now, at 27, I spent a lot of the many past years just working on myself. Sorting through trauma, trying to heal, and a lot of time in the gym.

I watered a lot of plants. The spiritual plant, the physical body plant, the art plant-but not so much, the career plant.

I’m ok. Much to work on. Much to heal from...but..I’m ok. Given the circumstances. Statistically I should be a convict, or have multiple children with multiple women, or an addict, etc.

I’m none of those things.

I feel I really starting to understand myself and well, life, as much as you can, yanno?

I understand career, money, is not everything, boy is it not. But I do realize, having a comfortable career where you’re not stretched financially, is beneficial for all other “plants” or aspects of life.

I started to dip my toe into programming; wondering, what is this? Cann I learn it? I saw on the top rated jobs on this website that is was rated #1 AND salaries can be easily of $50k/year.

Real quick, I mentioned art in one of my last’s paragraphs, talking about how I watered that plant. Well, I went from never drawing, to drawing at a somewhat pretty high level in realistic academic style art work; which for those who don’t know, isn’t like throwing paint on a canvas, it is VERY technical, it is a SKILL, and takes many years of practice and study. 

Long story short, I’m not sure I ever really liked drawing THAT much, I did like it, but I’m not sure I wanted to pursue it as a career anymore(I was really thinking about going all in on being an artist, trying to get into a gallery etc etc, as well as possibly being a tattoo artist, I was in multiple apprenticeships-but, idk, art was more of a way to access the flow state, to feel, to heal..not a career?..if that makes sense)

Anyway, I spent a lot of time on art, on reading, on exercise and healing, but nothing much on my career-though all these other plants I watered, I do feel will greatly help me in any job field bc they did help develop my character, despite if I can slap them on a resume!

So..

I’m at a crossroads.

My ability to get very good at art, taught me, anybody, including myself, can get VERY good at anything, so as they approach it the same way. A skill is a skill. All skills require practice, dedication, discipline, work ethic, curiousity, willingness to fail, and TIME. 

I started just playing around with simple coding challenges. Watching YouTube videos, yanno, like everyone else.

But now, I am SERIOUSLY considering trying to become a software engineer-but at 27, I understand, I don’t necessarily have all the time in the world. I mean, don’t get me wrong, I believe it is never too late to change paths and learn, that is what being a human is all about-but I also, know, that yanno, youth, time, energy-it’s a limited resource.

So..I guess a few questions I have (if you made it this far fcking THANK YOU!) are..or a few concerns are..

-Am I going to spend years trying to teach myself this, and maybe absolutely hate it/not be able to find a job? 

-Is this career going to be around? Are jobs going to be out there?

-What are some common paths in this field? 

-Those working in this field, is it something you enjoy?

,SoftwareEngineering,"**Backstory of Database over Application**

For a long time now, I've struggled with the fact that a lot of our logic at work resides in the database. We'll create a stored procedure for creating an entity and it'll contain the validation and creation of the entity. This methodology was originally started by my boss due the fact that changing a stored procedure doesn't require a recompile and deployment of code, so if something broke it could be fixed quickly. Naturally, there are a lot of problems with this line of thinking and ways to avoid it. I've since setup Azure DevOps so I can pull code from our repository and have it deployed with a single click of a button and a 5 minute wait (build &amp; test is most of it). My problem with the logic residing in the database is that it makes the (web) server portion of my applications feel like an empty shell that just forwards what the database gives it to the front-end, even more-so now that I'm getting into making SPAs.

**Lack of Database Resources**

I try to think about performance from time to time and one fact remains true: It does not matter the performance of the code I write, the database is *always* the bottleneck. It really doesn't matter how efficiently I write my server code. We've been running into situations where our SQL servers are choked for resources lately, and at first I was insistent that nothing could be done, we simply need more resources, but then I got to thinking. What if we stopped putting so much of the logic in the database and relied more on the application?

**My Reasoning**

I've always stuck with keeping the logic in the database (whether it be joining a ton of data, validating an object being created, etc.) because it was consistent with the methods already used and that it seemed to make sense that the database does the data job better (at least for the joining data part). However, our web servers sit at 25% resource utilization while our database servers are thirsty for resources (Mostly due to a large number of SSIS packages and data loading processes) and I'm starting to question this.

**Question(s)**

,SoftwareEngineering,"I've been working as a Software Engineer for over 6 years now and 3 years with my current company (a small startup that's doing pretty good) as a Software Engineer. The pay isn't bad, (almost 100k) and I never spend more than 8 hours working. (not the toxic competitive environment where engineers work late just because you can)

It's a pretty laid back company (everybody works remotely) with no real deadlines and a boss that has really no serious experience in software engineering, reacts very slow to Slack messages, agrees to my ideas to later have no clue, or is surprised something is already finished. (although often I usually can guess what he wants, so I do it before he asks)

He also usually has no clue whether a bug fix is going to be a 5 minute or 5-day fix. I'm kinda starting to hate this kind of environment meant, because I know I would be more productive if we as a team could work together instead of everybody on their own with no clear direction from a technical viewpoint.  We all as a team always say that we hate our legacy PHP codebase, but every push to make it better is always answered with ""yes great idea, next year we probably will have time"".

In a meeting last week when I asked my team member why we're using a certain technology that has no added value in my opinion I got the reply ""because someone thought that was a good idea at a certain point of time"". 

Occasionally I get into the mood to rebuild our stack, sometimes on my own time just because I want to get some serious work done that I'm proud of. (and I know it will make everyone more productive)  
It's those pieces that I usually use as building blocks to convince my boss of the bigger changes I rarely get to make. 

We spend a year as a team on making our product better and although the CTO was excited to announce the product got 50% faster my boss didn't even care when I told him I easily could speed it up another 50% that would be less than an hour effort. He said he was going to make a ticket (but that of course never happened).

I'm pretty sure that my boss is the reason why a lot of our code is kinda crappy, because he doesn't understand ""technical debt"" and always chooses the shortcut whenever possible.

Anyway, this is kinda the background in a nutshell. Usually what I do is I finish whatever my boss wants me to do and then switch over to my own goals (making the product faster, better, etc.)

I know I probably could get a job as a senior software engineer (I get bothered a lot by recruiters), but I don't want to risk losing this laid-back environment. Although I hate how inexperienced my boss is, I also like the fact that at least it's not micromanagement or a toxic environment where people compete and work all night.

I have some Q's ideally would like to connect via Zoom or something because in many cases I am not sure how best to ask, or know exactly what I am asking but can do my best to articulate these questions here:

1) when a Dev gets design specs for a new project (ex) new promotional landing page for a clients new product offering, what kind of work, and time go into coding that new landing page, how do they ""rig it up"" to ensure the CTA's on the new page leads to the various pages they are supposed to lead to?

2) Once  specs for design/ copy are given what does a Dev need from me/ the client in order to be able to begin building/coding (are building and coding synonyms in this context?) at the moment I send the devs a png file from the design team and say something like ""well here you go..."" and I dont know what is theyre doing to begin etc

3) Once a project like question #1 is complete how does the Dev transfer ""control"" of the new landing page to the client so the client can 1) adjust it with their internal team if they change their mind about something minor like copy after the fact? 2) what stops a malicious dev who built a site from going back into code and making malevolent adjustments and pushing those changes live w/o the client knowing in advance etc 

As is becoming obvious, I am not even sure what I am asking and Iam certainly over my head in this role which is more technical than I anticipated.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Looking for advice.

I am working a small side project where I take a spreadsheet of patient data where each row represents a statement that needs to be mailed to said patient. 

I built a UI to read a CSV file. A user will upload the CSV. The CSV is then represented on the UI as a table. The user can ""preview"" or ""send"" each statement from the table row by row, or ""send all"". The angular app does the api request to LOB and a statement is mailed via USPS snail mail. This is nice because there is no backend / no backend cost.

For simplicity I want the front end to do all these requests (send the statements). But, a problem I am for-seeing is that each month there will be around 10,000 statements to send. In this situation, if the user ""sends all"" from the browser it will take a little while to do 10,000 api requests. I am not sure how long but I am guessing 5-20 minutes, depending on internet connection. The user could just leave the browser tab open and work on something else. I'll provide a loading indicator that says do not close this tab or something like that.

What do you think? Should I go ahead and do something on the backend to do this instead? Or maybe just a cloud function? I am just worried about storing patient data and all that. Along with backend bandwidth costs, which I think would be minimal if I understand firebase network costs.

&lt;p&gt;I am working a small side project where I take a spreadsheet of patient data where each row represents a statement that needs to be mailed to said patient. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built a UI to read a CSV file. A user will upload the CSV. The CSV is then represented on the UI as a table. The user can &amp;quot;preview&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;send&amp;quot; each statement from the table row by row, or &amp;quot;send all&amp;quot;. The angular app does the api request to LOB and a statement is mailed via USPS snail mail. This is nice because there is no backend / no backend cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For simplicity I want the front end to do all these requests (send the statements). But, a problem I am for-seeing is that each month there will be around 10,000 statements to send.

,SoftwareEngineering,"(WARNING: highly opinionated question ahead)

We often hear success stories about those who quit their well paid (100k-300k usd per year) job, started own startup and succeeded.

We barely hear about those who failed.

I'm thinking about making myself a 1y break from work and do my own project (startup?). I can afford not working for a year. I see following benefits and threats.

Benefits:
- I will learn to think holistically about software (previously I was just a developer in big teams, where there was always someone to take care of other things)
- will solve real problems with software (more satisfying than another-jira-task)
- potentially make something great (if it succeed)
- I will strengthen my knowledge in areas I struggle

Dangers:
- I won't earn 1y salary
- I procrastinate
- I will be working mainly with myself, sitting home alone
- may struggle to find job with 1y gap in CV later

,SoftwareEngineering,"My general idea of designing is working out details which will help by reducing the rework on code and to help focus resources on the desired features and not undesired features.  Right now it seems, it's easier to code something than write the design but that rather pointless.  

I'm working on a home project, using C++ and SDL, and having some fun with making a 2D game engine.   I don't find UML useful but I am working solo, so no real surprise there.   The unit test I write seems to be the most helpful because they are tied to features I come with looking at tutorials and such, so looking at the unit test I can figure out what I been working on.

Right now it seems, it&amp;#39;s easier to code something than write the design but that rather pointless.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m working on a home project, using C++ and SDL, and having some fun with making a 2D game engine.   I don&amp;#39;t find UML useful but I am working solo, so no real surprise there.   The unit test I write seems to be the most helpful because they are tied to features I come with looking at tutorials and such, so looking at the unit test I can figure out what I been working on.&lt;/p&gt;

Much like the tax code, these rules may have had some meaning in how they were created--maybe a political favor or compromise--but to a computer (and often a developer) they are completely arbitrary. Our users actually have a professional education in all of this, to give you an idea of how complicated it is.

Our applications are Too Big and Too Confusing, resulting in a long ramp up time for new developers and lots of production problems. If someone adds an exemption for married filing jointly or separately...there's really nothing to immediately indicate if that is correct or not. If someone changes that to be limited to married filing separately then that's also not clearly correct or wrong, and it's not even clear if it's intentional or just an accident when updating something else for married filing jointly.

Unit tests would be added by the developer, but that's usually just going to reflect whatever the developer's understanding was...

There's lots of manual code inspection and manual testing but it's slow and sucks and doesn't even find all the problems. Especially with the logic that relates field 12b on form 123 to field 16 on form 142(f). And extra fun for urgent, last minute changes... 

We already have some obvious applications separated (business vs personal, each major tax jurisdiction can be its own thing, etc.) but the size of these is still painful.

It seems like we've run out of obvious smaller pieces...we could separate, say, married vs single but the overlap between the two is a lot larger than the differences, so this seems like it would be very WET (Write Everything Twice, opposite of DRY). We could split up form by form but there is all that pesky logic that goes across forms.

Oh, did I mention that we already write everything two or three times? In the db for simple constraints, in the service (always), and in the UI to provide a nice user experience where an invalid field is highlighted immediately...

Are there any design patterns or basic architectural models to get this nonsense under control?

For reference, we only have about six two-pizza teams to support everything (30-40 devs and about 10 dedicated manual testers). After breaking up the obvious chunks, we already have at least one large application and a couple of smaller/less important applications per team.

,SoftwareEngineering,"There's always an urge for me to write a function to transform the request/response body to/from a REST API on a client app. 

The data on the client-side is often different structured or named differently from its counterpart from the server-side. For example, a simple user profile data retrieved from a REST API could look something like this:

```

    {
      ""first_name"": ""John"",
      ""last_name"": ""Doe"",
      ""profile_pic"": ""https://imagebucket/john_doe.jpg""
    }

But the data structure on the client-side is:

    {
      ""name"": ""John Doe"",
      ""profilePic"": ""https://imagebucket/john_doe.jpg""
    }

To solve this issue, either the data from the REST API have to be transformed into the data structure expected by the client-side, or the client-side has to change the data expected to completely match the REST API data structure. 

Whilst the latter requires to write less code, I think it's not a good idea because it makes the client-side to have strong coupling with the server-side data. If the REST API changes its data structure, it requires a hefty change on the client-side to match the new data structure - not to mention the risk of bug if some part of the code that consumes the REST API data is not changed accordingly. 

In my head, the first solution (transforming data) is better, but I would like to do some sanity check to see if this is really good. Is it an anti-pattern? Is there a package out there to do this? Is this over-engineered?

I searched online for answers. To my surprise, there is very little resource that discusses this, and I don't find any package that does this. Oh, by the way, I'm coding in Javascript and React.js is my go-to language for client app programming. This is the closest (and maybe only?) article I found that actually discuss this idea: https://sendgrid.com/blog/using-the-adapter-design-pattern-with-react/

,SoftwareEngineering,"I've had a passion for embedded systems/computer systems straight out of University, but also due to my background in electro-mechanical systems, I ended up doing software for hybrid/electric (more-so electric now) powertrains and stuck with it for the last 6-7 years.

I primarily use Matlab/Simulink, which auto-generates the C code that is deployed onto ECUs, so it's not quite as software-savvy as I would have hoped and over these years, I've been contemplating as to whether I should really continue this path forward in my career.

YouTube- post videos.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey all.

I'm nowhere near being an expert nor a professional, but I can write a few lines of code (mainly Python and JS).

Even though I can think through a problem, design a database, write code for the business logic and the API, make the frontend make requests and etc, I have a hard time understanding how low-code/no-code software works.

It seems to me almost like ""metaprogramming"". Instead of writing instructions to the computer, you have to write instructions that receive instructions on how to write instructions? So for example, I could something like this:

    def get_data(params) -&gt; list:
        url = config.base_url + params
        data = request.get(url)
        data_list = data['raw_data']
        treated_data = [each * 2 for each in data_list]
        return treated_data

Probably not the best example, but it may help to frame the question... how would something like this be translated into a no-code structure?

I could have something like:

    def make_get_request(params):
        return request.get(params)

Which looks ok, makes sense, I could build a form in the frontend that gets the parameters, make them match to the `requests` library, and have an API endpoint that runs that function. But I honestly can't think how to solve anything even slightly more complicated than that.

This is a hard topic to Google, since I can only get tons of results with no-code platforms, and none with how the internals work.

Any ideas or resources that could help me understand the topic a bit better?

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def get_data(params) -&amp;gt; list:
    url = config.base_url + params
    data = request.get(url)
    data_list = data[&amp;#39;raw_data&amp;#39;]
    treated_data = [each * 2 for each in data_list]
    return treated_data
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not the best example, but it may help to frame the question... how would something like this be translated into a no-code structure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def make_get_request(params):
    return request.get(params)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which looks ok, makes sense, I could build a form in the frontend that gets the parameters, make them match to the &lt;code&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; library, and have an API endpoint that runs that function. But I honestly can&amp;#39;t think how to solve anything even slightly more complicated than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a hard topic to Google, since I can only get tons of results with no-code platforms, and none with how the internals work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any ideas or resources that could help me understand the topic a bit better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

Logically, you either have to rename the column first or deploy the new code first. Seems like for it to work, for some snapshot in time, your code has to work with both versions of the db?

A simpler solution would be to take the service down for 30 minutes every time you deploy but that's lame.

The product I am working on is a web-based form builder app. I've thought of a use case diagram however the first version hasn't been well-received by the product team, calling it too complicated so looking for suggestions or any tips or advice, please.

I also think if a use case diagram as a UML diagram is the best thing to represent the user journey as well as add all the technical/technical architecture details.

My main outcome for the improved diagram or visual is to:

1. Explain the technical components in terms of what functionality they provide for the end user and what they help the end user achieve

I believe Information architecture UX design may be something that succinctly explains what i'm trying to do.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi all,

Having a real tough time deciding between 2 job offers at the moment.

Both firms are London based, but offering fully remote work which means I can work from Northern Ireland.

Background:

1. 25M, Senior Software Engineer
2. Just under 5 years experience
3. Been leading UI domain in my team now for 18 months
4. Angular Expert, fullstack with Java/Spring/Spring Boot

Firm 1 is offering:

1. 75K - Title: Software Engineer
2. 2 week trips to London every quarter - expenses paid
3. Whenever Covid blows over, potential remote work from Brazil (GF is Brazilian), making it easier for us to travel there.
4. No bonus system as of yet - they've said they're hoping to have some bonus system finalised early 2021, for end of year next year
5. 4% matched pension
6. 2000 dollar learning budget
7. Macbook Pro &amp; iPhone
8. Tech used: React, Kotlin

Firm 2 is aware of the first offer, because I've been interacting with both firms through the same recruiting company, although through two separate individuals within the company.

Firm 2 have stated that they do not want to provide any salary details right now, because they don't want to get into a bidding war for me. So right now I don't have much to go off.

Firm 2 is offering:

1. Potential 5 - 10K more per year (500£ net per month extra) Up to 95K.
2. Title: Principal Software Engineer
3. Guaranteed option to work remotely from Brazil as needed
4. They haven't commented on how often they would like me to visit the office
5. 10% bonus, 5% pension
6. Angular, Java

I consider UI development to be a bit of a hobby of mine. I've always wanted to learn react, and in my current role am not happy with how I'm not getting to code as much as I want to. Firm 2 - The Principle position will involve similar things to what I do today, with more responsibility.

Firm 1 - will give me the opportunity to learn React and Kotlin. It's technically a step down from my current title, and two steps down from the other role, but the salary is still at the senior level. They've also acknowledged my leadership skills and the goal would be to prep for promotion to Senior in 2021, if thats worth anything. They've said they want me to build a stronger development base first.

&amp;#x200B;

Am i crazy to chose Firm 1, the lower paying job wit the lowet title for these reasons:

* Get to learn react and kotlin, expand the technologies i know - React open up more employment options in future, and I've always wanted to learn react.
* Get to code more than I am now
* When I do get promoted to Senior - I should be near enough to the salary from firm 2
* Quality of developer seems to be high, I did 7 hours of interviews and had to build a website for them, one of the guys that interviewed even said that to me without me bringing it up
* Just got a better vibe from them, my gut is telling me to go for them over Firm 2

Appreciate any advice.

,SoftwareEngineering,"To expand on the title, I am a junior software engineer with around 2 YOE professionally.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I'm fairly familiar with the concepts of TDD, but I think I've got a good argument for when it doesn't work, and test last might be a better strategy. However, I haven't actually put TDD into practice beyond the basic tutorials everyone's done.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my hypothetical that's based in reality:

You need to implement a slightly complex piece of functionality, in this example a function that takes 2 numbers and an operator, then either adds or subtracts. So you go ahead and write the code in a regular ""recursive"" mindset, where you implement the functions to add and subtract first, then implement the parent function that relies on both the implemented functions. A complete implementation in Go might be something like this (written in the order they were implemented):

    func addNumbers(i1, i2 int) {
        return i1 + i2
    }
    
    func subtractNumbers(i1, i2 int) {
        return i1 - i2
    }
    
    func multiplyNumbers(i1, i2 int) {
        return i1 * i2
    }
    
    func AddOrSubtractNumbers(i1, i2 int, operator char) (result int) {
        switch operator {
        case '+':
            return addNumbers(i1, i2)
        case '-':
            return subtractNumbers(i1, i2)
        }
        return 0
    }

Notice that we wrote an extra multiplyNumbers function. This is because we thought we would need the parent function to implement all basic operators, but only realised when we were implementing the parent function that it wasn't necessary for the rest of the program. In the above example without tests, this is a relatively cheap mistake, because we can just delete the function and move on. But if we were writing tests along the way, we would've lost both the cost of implementing the function, and implementing the tests for it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a overly simplistic example, but the point is that the ""unit"" that we're testing is too granular. The unit should really be the parent function **including** its dependents, not each individual dependent function. But even so, when following rule 1 of TDD we couldn't implement those basic functions without first writing tests for them. So we end up having to write tests for code that won't actually be applicable to the final unit, which ultimately get deleted.

&amp;#x200B;

This is far worse in real world examples in my experience, as the overall public unit gets refactored and tweaked along the way continuously, like changing function signatures and data types, or increasing the logic separation further. If I were TDD'ing along the way, every one of those smaller refactors would be far more difficult and expensive, not to mention frustrating. If writing tests afterwards, once the whole ""unit"" is properly assembled, it is far less frustrating and the cost of writing and constantly refactoring the intermediate tests isn't lost.

&amp;#x200B;

However, like I said at the start, I haven't actually done this in practice so I'm unsure if my understanding is incorrect.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I found a quote on hacker news that sums up my concerns perfectly:

&gt;Oftentimes the implementation is in such flux that continually updating the test as I go along is tedious and kills the creative flow.

I'm often still figuring out what I need to implement and its interface **as I'm writing it**, so writing the tests before the implementation for anything more complex than simple algorithmic utility functions seems foolhardy, as I'm spending so much more effort updating the tests as I go along with my implementation of the unit.

    return i1 * i2
}

func AddOrSubtractNumbers(i1, i2 int, operator char) (result int) {
    switch operator {
    case &amp;#39;+&amp;#39;:
        return addNumbers(i1, i2)
    case &amp;#39;-&amp;#39;:
        return subtractNumbers(i1, i2)
    }
    return 0
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that we wrote an extra multiplyNumbers function. This is because we thought we would need the parent function to implement all basic operators, but only realised when we were implementing the parent function that it wasn&amp;#39;t necessary for the rest of the program. In the above example without tests, this is a relatively cheap mistake, because we can just delete the function and move on. But if we were writing tests along the way, we would&amp;#39;ve lost both the cost of implementing the function, and implementing the tests for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a overly simplistic example, but the point is that the &amp;quot;unit&amp;quot; that we&amp;#39;re testing is too granular. The unit should really be the parent function &lt;strong&gt;including&lt;/strong&gt; its dependents, not each individual dependent function. But even so, when following rule 1 of TDD we couldn&amp;#39;t implement those basic functions without first writing tests for them. So we end up having to write tests for code that won&amp;#39;t actually be applicable to the final unit, which ultimately get deleted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is far worse in real world examples in my experience, as the overall public unit gets refactored and tweaked along the way continuously, like changing function signatures and data types, or increasing the logic separation further. If I were TDD&amp;#39;ing along the way, every one of those smaller refactors would be far more difficult and expensive, not to mention frustrating. If writing tests afterwards, once the whole &amp;quot;unit&amp;quot; is properly assembled, it is far less frustrating and the cost of writing and constantly refactoring the intermediate tests isn&amp;#39;t lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, like I said at the start, I haven&amp;#39;t actually done this in practice so I&amp;#39;m unsure if my understanding is incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I found a quote on hacker news that sums up my concerns perfectly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes the implementation is in such flux that continually updating the test as I go along is tedious and kills the creative flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m often still figuring out what I need to implement and its interface &lt;strong&gt;as I&amp;#39;m writing it&lt;/strong&gt;, so writing the tests before the implementation for anything more complex than simple algorithmic utility functions seems foolhardy, as I&amp;#39;m spending so much more effort updating the tests as I go along with my implementation of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, if there&amp;#39;s an outage, I&amp;#39;m lost when it comes to talking to the necessary teams, acquiring impact information and generally coming up with and helping with a solution. How can I take steps to take more ownership and responsibility with my job? Or do you feel this is something that comes with more time? &lt;/p&gt;

I am in the process of creating a curriculum at university level for a course on software architecture- and design patterns in context of cyberphysical systems (CPSs).

While I do not expect a book that maps 1:1 to this rather specific topic, I was wondering if any of you could provide me with some inspiration for books on the topic of software architectural patterns and design patterns in general (combined would be great).

I'd welcome any other input as well, but getting hold of some literature would be my preferred first step.

I have done research in the field, and could use papers in my teaching, but I would much prefer the more pedagogical approach usually offered by coherent books.

,SoftwareEngineering,"My very first programming class at university, I was taught that global variables are bad. After getting to work with GUI events, network calls, multiple threads, and especially as I studied functional programming, it became crystal clear why. It became my motto that shared state needs to be managed very carefully, should be avoided at all whenever possible, and that global variables are out of the question for a serious project. 

My journey went on, and I learned about important design patterns such as MVC/MVVM, how to write clean and readable code, efficient algorithms, encapsulation and so on. After university, I got a trainee job in a back-end team and got schooled hard on the importance of separating concerns, always using dependency injection, how to make code testable, caching, and so on. During this year, I took the opportunity to ask the seniors a lot of questions and I really dove into the theoretical world of software development, reading about its history, common anti-patterns, debated principles, and the future of the industry. It was great fun. I learned that software engineering isn’t trying random stuff until it works, but that there is a technique to it. 

Then I got into the real world. My first real job, as a mobile developer, and what do I see? Global variables. A multi-threaded, GUI-event driven, network-call heavy, massive and highly configurable app, running on millions of phones in a dozen countries, and it’s absolutely littered with global variables. And my job was now to play a never-ending game of whack-a-mole trying to debug this spaghetti monster. Dependency injection was nowhere in sight, MVC completely disregarded (seriously, the service classes presented dialog boxes), no documentation and almost all code was duplicated several times. They had even duplicated the entire 2000+ file repository to create the almost identical TV version of the app, and had been keeping them manually in sync for years. 

The original developers were gone and everyone now in the team acknowledged the horror of this codebase. But the thing is, a few years have now passed and I have seen a few projects, worked with a lot of different people, and it’s always like this. Code duplication, global state, code duplication, global state, nested ifs, and unintelligible comments. Then I got the great privilege of starting a fresh codebase for a big project, and thought it would be different this time around, because I got to be there all the way, upholding some principles. But it has been nothing but an uphill battle. Every single day, in every single code review, I have to point out the same sorts of things. Please refrain from using global state, please always use dependency injection, please add tests, you mustn’t write network code directly in a view class, and no, copying and pasting an entire class and then changing a single line is not the correct way to create a new view. It’s bad, it never gets better and I am now starting to lose my patience with this work. 

Am I a perfectionist? Am I some kind of freak for being interested in code quality, and taking all of this stuff seriously?

Ideally, MIT's/UMich's/Berkeley's EECS major would be absolutely perfect, but those schools are very competitive and I need to have a plan B.

Edit: Could I go into robotics with a CS degree alone?

Edit3: how well does EE prepare for those notoriously hard SE interview questions?

Edit 4: i like making video games, websites, mobiles apps, and desktop applications and just started experimenting with systems through my robotics club.  When i think of software development i think of coding applications productivity apps like zenkit or making video games.  That's the kind of software engineering i a have explored the most thus far in high school

**edit 5: i am thinking of doing a BSEE w/ embedded systems or control systems concentration &amp; w/ a CS minor.  Then, I might do a Master's in Computer science w/ physics/math/or robotics minor.**

edit2: also, the reason why i posted is because i just joined my school's robotics team and it is better than anything i could imagine.  i help remotely with the programming ('cause of covid) and we are building a robot for a competition.  this we recently had a meet and spent the longest time trying to figure out why the robot wasn't working and even though we were stressing out i had a smile on my face the whole time.  eventually we figured it out and it felt like we launched a rocket ship because we were so happy.  so whatever that was, i want to do that as a job because it was just so much fun.  if it were not for covid i would be helping build the physical robot and that's something i really want to try too.",t2_58nij5ut,False,,0,False,Would a degree in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science be enough to get jobs/internships as a software developer or robotics engineer?,[],r/SoftwareEngineering,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_kaviw1,False,dark,0.5,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,False,self,1607707795.0,,[],{},,True,,1607689056.0,text,6,,,text,self.SoftwareEngineering,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t make up my mind what I want to study in college.  I have an interest in robotics, I know I love programming/computer science, and I want to be an astronaut but I also want to be able to fall back on a software engineering job if I am not selected to be an astronaut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, MIT&amp;#39;s/UMich&amp;#39;s/Berkeley&amp;#39;s EECS major would be absolutely perfect, but those schools are very competitive and I need to have a plan B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 4: i like making video games, websites, mobiles apps, and desktop applications and just started experimenting with systems through my robotics club.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Good evening Folks,

My post is in regards to switching my major from Cyber and Network Security to Software Engineering at PennState Online. (The degree is accredited by the ABET if that matters) I've been doing IT related work for more than a few years. This entails Customer Support, Troubleshooting, Basic Networking, SysAdmin, Security Admin., etc.

I've always had the creative mind and consistently think of different ideas(Solutions to Modern Problems, Apps, Games, Entertainment, Delivering a complete product). However, I don't bring the ideas to life, other than writing ideas down. This is because I don't have the skills too. This is my reason why I want to switch my major to SE. So I can become educated in the field and start executing my ideas. The only reason I am doing the Cyber and Network Security is due to the fact it  is related to the job I've been doing. Don't get me wrong, I like the job and the field of study a lot. However, something inside of me is pulling me towards SE.

I definitely feel I would be more happy working my ideas, even if I do it on the side. I've done basic programming and network scripting courses. I don't mind the work, I like it. I just don't know how much deeper this gets, but I can only assume tremendously deeper.  I know I can do it and I am willing to do it. I just honestly don't know if I would enjoy it.

Any information or mentorship offered from Software Engineers I would greatly appreciate. Please feel free to ask me questions.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I work on a team of five in a corporate setting on an important, albeit non-critical application.

Oddly, she is not any more productive than the rest of us, just constantly in a hurry and subtlety complaining about how much work there is.

I spoke to her almost a year ago about it in the context of work life balance, something that our workplace promotes. The conversation went no where but a few days later, I was spoken to by the team lead and asked why I was displeased with the zealot. I just repeated myself regarding work life and the conversation ended. But now as I said, the constant pressure of our team's workaholic is changing everyone. It creates stress where none needs to be. It cuts into all of our personal lives by needing to check messages and pull requests at all hours. And it is completely unnecessary.

,SoftwareEngineering,"My company keep tracks of software engineers via a website called Flow, which tracks your activity on GitHub and assesses your productivity rate and creates a report quarterly for quarterly reviews.

I personally think it is a horrible practice because it doesn't give any context to leadership, it is more like a color chart like the one on github shows your activity.

A side product of this approach was -naturally- all developers started to doing very small commits literally like 1 line commits to the repos. To make the color chart go crazy.

On top of that the same system shows the PR comments in a different color, and I realized pr comment amount also sky rocketed, with either redundant comments such as ""This part looks good to me"" or ""Nice solution"" etc.. (If it is fine just approve it.... You don't need to say this part looks good)

One specific engineer started to have this gatekeeping attitude even tho he is not authorized to do so... He is trying to argue everything and try to leave comments for anything, and trying to be assertive. This includes a lot of opinion based on comments.

For example arguing about variable names such as archived is not a good enough name it needs to be isArchived. Or many other examples like in one PR he is suggesting we do the stuff one way even tho we havent discussed it, because he feels strongly about it, then when I ask him to do the same in his PRs he is complaining about tight deadlines and not really need to do it that way.

This started to really really bother me lately because PRs almost taking more time than QA and Development itself, I believe he is trying to leave as many comments as possible, he is also doing unofficial QA to PRs in the evenings to find issues (If he can't find any issues on GitHub pr, he downloads the branch and runs the app and goes thru each test cases just to add a comment saying that there is a bug on the code, next day).

So PR review time increased from 2-3 hours to almost to 2 days because of all this changes and people.

If I knew that this was a genuine attempt to keep the code perfect I wouldn't be writing this post now, but I really think that it is an effort to be dominant and unofficially try to own the code base, and architecture and show leadership that he is doing many many comments on the PRs so they can see that in reports.

I am the most senior person in the team with 9 years experience and worked in 4 different companies including twice or triple size teams where 2 out of 15 people get randomly assigned to PRs. This is a very small team and same 2 devs have to go thru each PRs. This dev graduated in 2017 and I understand he is really hungry for promotion or compensation. But I have never seen this attitude before.

I realized my answers to this specific person's pr comments are very angry and confrontational, almost any of the opinion comments I am retaliating and saying it is his opinion, not backed by any data or use case and I don't find it accurate and I won't change it.

Which is a terrible approach but I can't stop myself. How do I approach this situation?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Ok, so here's where I am at.

I'm a professional software engineer who writes some apps for my own personal usage in my spare time. Because... I guess I spend too much time in front of a computer. But I digress. networking is something I know enough about to get by, but I wouldn't call myself an expert on.

I've got a bunch of apps running in a Kubernetes cluster on my home PC. I have shared some with some friends. I have a No-IP hostname setup that links to my machine. I did port forwarding with my router, using ports in the 8000s. So app 1 runs on port 8001, app 2 on port 8002, etc. So for one of my friends to access an app, they use [https://my-hostname.ddns.com:8001](https://my-hostname.ddns.com:8001). It's the 8001 that I want to get rid of.

What I would like to do is have a standard hostname that just relies on ports 80/443 for HTTP/S traffic. I'm going to setup a whole gateway where a single entrypoint redirects to the various apps, so I'm not worried about that. What I am worried about is the port usage.

If I setup this single entrypoint, I would be doing port forwarding between 80/433 on my router and my desktop. I wouldn't be using the 80/443 ports on my desktop itself, just on the router. I know how to do all this, how to set it up, etc.

My fear is the downside. If I were to set this up, would it interfere with my normal web traffic in any way? Those are pretty standard ports, so I'm concerned. I need all web traffic through my router from all my other devices to work as normal.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi Guys,

I  wanted to change my career path, so much so that I've applied to study Computer Science as a masters degree (my undegrad was in Earth Science, so pretty unrelated). This is doable with the right Computer Science course, as in you don't need to have studied Computer Science for your BSc.

I lost my main Earth Science-related job due to Coronavirus, and i'm currently in a similar job I really don't like (basically doing more of the same work but for way less pay - however they have said they can possibly give me part time work while I study, which means I could keep the job if I study part time).

I have 2 offers to start ""remote study"" courses in January, one which is from York (a really good university, but is part-time and would take 2 years) - and one of which is from Hertfordshire (a less prestigious university, but is 1 year full-time).

I really want to get into a Software Engineering career as quickly as possible, as I feel I'm already too old to be hanging about (29), so two years part time study, while doing an unrelated job I don't really enjoy doesn't sound great, though I would be getting my degree at a much better university...

Do you think having the cred of a Russell Group University would be worth the extra years study? As in, would future Software Engineering employers look much more favourtably at my application with a masters from York, or should I just go for 1 year full time at Herts and quit the unrelated job I don't  like entirely? (I've saved enough to be able to do this).

If I did take the 2 year part time Masters course, at what stage could I realistically start applying for jobs in the industry?

I know there are other routes into the industry like code bootcamps, but I've read a lot about how having a masters gives you a broader understanding, and helps in the long run.

I'm 27 in California no college experience have worked as a cook and in construction since high-school. I'm wondering if going back to school to get a degree in business or get a contractors license to start a construction company or something  or computer science (but that will be 2-4 years from now when I'm getting employed), or attend a software engineering bootcamp or try and teach myself which seems impossible atm.The education system and  attending class is also kind of foreign to me not having attended school since highschool and I've been trying my best to start studying coding but am very overwhelmed and don't really know what I'm doing.

 I have friends in the field who thought I may be good at it. im currently taking prep courses for a software engineering bootcamp since its 9-5 so it forces me to spend time on it and there are people there to answer questions and put me in touch with my peers who are starting off as well. I feel like I'm one of the only people in the class (probably not true)  that's feeling completely intimidated by going into this with basically no understanding of the the languages and what exactly is going on. I don't know if I'm taking the right steps to set me up for success.

 I'm not looking for some golden ticket with the bootcamp I understand that I will get out what I put in with coding and that the more time I spend on my free time the better I will get but I don't really even know where to start on my free time. What languages to prioritize in the job market, whats going to make me more flexible, or if this is even the right choice for me.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi All, 

As the title suggests I am currently based in London working in a junior accounting role within a company conducting very mundane tasks which has resulted in me being constantly bored and unmotivated. I have always had a keen interest in technology and was wondering given the situation and time on my hands if it’s possible to change careers for the better especially whilst I’m still young (mid 20’s)! 

I have a BSc in Accounting so haven’t done any coding previously or have any experience. I’m looking to dip my toes in the water before I get fully into it but wanted some advice regarding where to start and if it’s even possible to move? What languages would you recommend to learn and where can I go about doing this whilst also being fairly feasible. 

There’s a lot of courses on full-stack engineering but from what I understand this is all to do with websites and database communication, would doing a course in this be a step towards becoming a software engineer? 

Finally what certificates/courses would you recommend for someone like me in order to company for the lack of formal education in computer science. 

I appreciate any help and would be keen to get in touch with those like myself or experienced professionals for mentorship!

,SoftwareEngineering,"I'm looking at sending commands over a queue. Workers are in a defined datacentre, and commands are _ideally_ processed by a worker in the same datacentre as the target of the command.

I suppose that this is a job for [Competing Consumers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/competing-consumers) - but I'm open to other ideas.

The most likely queue implementation will be Azure Service Bus, although this is not set in stone yet. We're currently leaning towards C# for the workers, although python is in the picture.

The current solution has one queue per datacentre. The workload is bursty, so we expect the worker pool to be frequently maxed out and for the queue to back up for a bit. This is not a disaster, as the solution that we're replacing typically clears the queue within a minute or two - but it is also not great, because there's an interactive aspect to the app as a whole, and the typical round trip is 30 seconds.

What I would like to achieve is to have workers take command messages for their own datacentre as a priority but, if they are otherwise idle, to be able to step in for the other datacentres. E.g. when Berlin is backed up but Tokyo is sitting idle, I'd like Tokyo to start taking Berlin messages.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello everyone, I've currently been working in the IT field for 3 years now. I've recently decided to start studying for my Network+ certification, and will pursue further education after that. Things are going well and I'm confident ill pass, but I've recently have been looking into Software development as well. Did a little bit of research in the field and I definitely find it more interesting that what I'm currently  working on. I can see myself having more enjoyment in this field than I would being a network engineer. 

Now my question is, do you guys thinks it worth it to switch over from what I'm currently working on. I went to College for a few semesters but never finished my degree. Everything I know about IT and network engineering in self thought. I'm sure teaching myself to become a software dev wont be easy, but I'm positive I can do it.  Not sure how much knowledge from what I learned about Routing &amp; Switching would carry over, but I don't mind starting from scratch in learning a new skill. I live in NYC if that changes anything, let me know what you guys think.

It comes in two flavors:

A.) You’re password is old, you must change your password to login

B.) You can not change your password to one of your previous passwords. 

I use a password system. It uses my own sequencing system to give every account I login to a unique password that is both unrelated to me, long, and uses broken words that make it hard for brute force to find word connections.

When I’m forced to change my password it breaks the system. So it’s either, update the entire system and change every single one of my passwords, or just give up on whatever account it is that is forcing me to do this and just accept I’ll have to reset my password every time. 

I’ve noticed that over time I just stop using those services. Facebook was one of these, and now tonight the dominos app. I got so fed up that every thing I was putting into the reset password box for dominos was coming back that it was a previous password that I just deleted that app.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi all,

I was wondering if any software engineers had any experience improving their speaking and assertive abilities during work and design sessions with other engineers. I grew up very shy and in my upbringing, I was told never to question things from parents or elders. With that foundation, sometimes I find myself anxious when I speak on an idea, and then some guy or girl gives a different perspective on an idea, and I find myself not sticking to my idea and going through with their ideas (not saying all my ideas are perfect). Now I know I can't control what other engineers think, and if there's a better solution, I'd go with it too. I think maybe it's the fear of confrontation I have, but anyhow, if you encountered situations like this, how did you overcome it? And what did you do to reinstate your ideas and stick to it?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi there, excuse the long post, I feel like I’m at a turning point in my life, at a bit of a loose end and I have come to Reddit for advice before, and it’s always turned out quite well – so bear with me!

I’m 29 years old with a 2:1 bachelor’s degree in Environmental Earth Science, I got an Environmental Monitoring Technician job straight out of Uni at a small consultancy, and this progressed after a year to being a Environmental Tech for one of the country’s largest quarry companies, reporting directly to the Environment Agency. The only problem is, this doesn’t seem to have led very far career-wise, and even though my responsibilities have increased, I’m still manually collecting the same contaminated water samples that I was when I first graduated. This obviously isn’t at the salary I was dreaming of, either. I’m now considering a change in career path.

I’ve always had an interest in computers and code, I feel like I’m always solving everybody’s’ computer problems, there’s several examples in my life where I’ve written or devised myself little programs or macros to speed my jobs up (my company uses one of my Excel Macros daily now for environmental data, maybe I should have charged them for it!). Unfortunately, i’m not exclusively proficient in anything, for example I have several GitHub python scripts for sorting retro-game roms (just a hobby), which I’ve sort of cobbled together with other people’s groundwork and the power of google, nothing has been written from scratch. The same goes for web design and HTML, I’ve done several Webites and CSS, but to be honest everything has been Google-searched and then copy/pasted to achieve the effects I want (my point being here I’m familiar with these types of things, but in no way proficient). I wouldn’t say I'm incredibly mathematically minded, either.

Obviously, some of the Software Engineering salaries look very lucrative – for example I have a ""Python DevOps Engineer"" housemate on more than £50K a year, more than double what I am earning, and from what I observe her job is quite cushty, she works relaxed hours from home &amp; she basically says whenever she encounters a problem she can’t fix, she googles it! I know she’s probably undervaluing her worth, but it certainly sounds like something I could do! I always seem to be helping her sort out her actual “why won’t my webcam work” computer issues, too – which I find quite amusing for someone so highly paid in the tech industry.

I was just wondering, based on people’s experience and what I have described, whether my fellow Redditors would recommend trying to push my career into this path, or if not, tell me I don’t sound suitable. It’s a massive thing trying to go in a completely different path, and if anyone had any reservations or advice it would be really helpful to hear it.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi, I'm in charge of the IT development and business analysis in a dental university in montreal and we are currently analysing a project for student assignation. Before we get into a internal development I was wondering if any product exist already. Basically we have 10 clinic witch vary from 10 to 40 place, each clinic have particular treatments, in witch students(300) go around to do their quotas. 

In each clinic they are clinicians with are responsible for between 3 and 7 student.

All the specific quotas are in our dental erp but the physical location is done by hand by the clerk in a homemade excel file where they dispatch all the student in the different clinics. This process takes about 2 to 6 hours per day depending on the Excel skills of the clerks.

I'm trying for find something I could adapt to this process and at least generate most of the dispatch automatically. Of course they are a lot of business rules that have to be done by hand because they would be too complicated to program but if I could save 80% of that time, I would consider that as a success.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I've been a software engineer for almost 7 years, at the start of this year I took a head of tech job at a startup and we've been incredibly luck in that our product has actually really flourished during the pandemic, so as such we're getting a big investment in January and as part of that the board want me to expand my team as well as offering a bonus scheme to incentivise the current engineers and tempt the prospective ones.

So, they want me to come up with how this bonus structure is going to work, the problem is that the board all come from a sales background where bonuses are generally ""make a sale, get x% commission"" and I believe are expecting me to come back with something similar for engineers, e.g ""finish X stories get X bonus"" but I just don't think that works for what we do.

Not only that but I've been reading ""Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us"" (great book btw, for any of you managers out there) where the author puts forward the point that 'carrot &amp; stick' incentives, while great for purely mechanical labour, actually reduce the passion and creativity of knowledge based workers.

But of course we all have rent to pay and new GPUs to buy, so it would be insane to turn down the idea of the bonus, but it's about doing it right. So I'd love to get the input of the software engineers of Reddit. What would you do?

I'm thinking maybe something along the lines of a ""guaranteed"" bonus of X%, so it would more or less form part of the salary, the difference being it can be taken away if the company hit financial straights or if the engineer in question really doesn't deserve it (although if we're hiring the right people, I can't see that happening). The board wouldn't even necessarily have to view it any different in that case; the work gets done, the bonuses get paid.
On top of that I'm thinking part of the ""bonus"" could even be (rather than a pure monetary bonus) some sort of learning budget for each engineer to spend on books/courses/seminars etc. or even equipment. Essentially something to encourage learning/innovation etc.

I know that was a bit of a stream of consciousness, but I'm not 100% on what I want to pitch to the board, I just want to make sure we do this right and we encourage the right form of productivity etc.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Recently I was exposed to the “wrong thinking” approach in brainstorming, and I have to say it’s been a great experience. 

TL;DR — Counterintuitively, thinking at the worst solutions for a problem makes a group converge faster and better on the best ones as well, and provides a lot of insights that would get lost otherwise.

Such information sharing platforms do not exist in isolation, and part of the evidence that they exist in a broader software documentation ecosystem is the common presence of hyperlinks to other documentation resources found in forum posts. With the goal of helping to improve the information diffusion between Stack Overflow and other documentation resources, we conducted a study to answer the question of how and why documentation is referenced in Stack Overflow threads. We sampled and classified 759 links from two different domains, regular expressions and Android development, to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the links' context and purpose, including attribution, awareness, and recommendations. We found that links on Stack Overflow serve a wide range of distinct purposes, ranging from citation links attributing content copied into Stack Overflow, over links clarifying concepts using Wikipedia pages, to recommendations of software components and resources for background reading.

Such information sharing platforms do not exist in isolation, and part of the evidence that they exist in a broader software documentation ecosystem is the common presence of hyperlinks to other documentation resources found in forum posts. With the goal of helping to improve the information diffusion between Stack Overflow and other documentation resources, we conducted a study to answer the question of how and why documentation is referenced in Stack Overflow threads. We sampled and classified 759 links from two different domains, regular expressions and Android development, to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the links&amp;#39; context and purpose, including attribution, awareness, and recommendations. We found that links on Stack Overflow serve a wide range of distinct purposes, ranging from citation links attributing content copied into Stack Overflow, over links clarifying concepts using Wikipedia pages, to recommendations of software components and resources for background reading.

,SoftwareEngineering,"**Background**
Hi all, made this post realizing that although I have a vast appreciation and love for low-level software and for electrical engineering concepts in my degree curriculum, I ultimately would love to take on a more creative role in the tech industry, as its something I feel is more sustainable for me long-term. I find myself getting drained because the work is hard and I find myself not enjoying it as much. Its always fascinated me how people create beautiful webpages and design really intuitive, great UIs and I feel like I've always been someone who is much more a visual learner and feels better about my work when I can see the results tangibly.

**Question:**

My question is, knowing that my degree is primarily in low-level software programming and backend implementation side of things (C, C++, Python for creating simulators for ECE projects, etc..., Embedded Systems), ...


- ...what is a good career path to go towards if I want to do something more creatively suited? UX Development or Front-End Engineering? What differences lie between them and thoughts on anyone else who has made a similar transition, such as first steps from here?

,SoftwareEngineering,"in grade school and in high school, ive always been horrible at math. i guess i just developed this dislike towards it that as I went further into my education, i never really made any effort to be somewhat good at math. like i mean, i always failed the subject lol i dont even know how i graduated highschool. i wouldn't say i am stupid, math was just not my strength and definitely my weakness too.

having said that, how important is it to be good at math to become a software engineer? is math something you always deal with when working?

ive considered software engineering because this year i got furloughed and it really made me realize a lot of things as well as gave me the time to look for other career opportunities. at first, i was into illustration. and then graphic design. and along my search process, ive learned software engineering is a great job and pays well too. 

i don't have any background at all when it comes to this. i didnt go to college. i know a little bit of html stuff from friendster and tumblr but that's it lol

here are some of my questions:

1. do you think the only people that should consider this are those who truly are passionate about coding/software engineering?
2. how realistic is it for someone with no coding experience, to be successful in this job and love it too?
3. ive always been more into art, like drawing and painting. no experience really in the tech side of things. but now that i am older, im feel like im growing an interest. where should i start learning?
4. what are the different kinds of software engineers? and which is the one that deals with math the least? 😅

,SoftwareEngineering,"I am a data scientist with little to no engineering background. I am working on a side project where I am detecting the position of every champion from the minimap on Leage of Legends.  I managed to make the detection accurate and fast, but I don't know how to store the results.

I read from googling that NoSQL paradigms are better for sensor data, which kind of is. But I also read that if some data seems easy to make it into a table, it should be SQL every time unless you have the data volumes Google has.

It seems easy to make it into a table with fields:

* \[unique\_id|game\_id|frame\_id|timer|champion|team|position\_x|position\_y\]

&lt;p&gt;I read from googling that NoSQL paradigms are better for sensor data, which kind of is. But I also read that if some data seems easy to make it into a table, it should be SQL every time unless you have the data volumes Google has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems easy to make it into a table with fields:&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"We're currently using the Apache Camel Java DSL to structure our application, but I guess this question can apply to any DSL in general.

Now, amongst our developers, we are divided on two polar opinions as to how to structure our codebase:

**Approach 1:**

Use the DSL as rarely as possible, and stick to using plain Java classes for representing our business logic. Our code is driven by the DSL, so the idea is to delegate the processing to a Java class as soon as possible, so that the rest of the logic is not dependent on the DSL.

Pros:

\- Your code is mostly decoupled from the framework. Useful if you want to replace the framework with something else.

Cons:

\- You are not making full use of the DSL, which abstracts out so much boilerplate code for you. You might as well not use the DSL at all in the code, and it would not make any difference.

\- (Specific to Apache Camel) Since the DSL is provided by a framework, the moment you delegate the business logic to a Java class, you cannot use the DSL again within any of the code that is called by the class. So if you want to use a functionality that the DSL provides within a Java class, then you would have to implement it yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

**Approach 2:**

Use the DSL to structure the 'backbone' of our business logic. The actual operations would be defined in modular plain Java methods, which would be called through the DSL.

Pros:

\- You are making full use of the DSL. If you want to execute an operation that the DSL completely abstracts out for you, you can do it without reinventing the wheel.

\- The codebase, while still coupled to the framework / DSL, is still highly modular. It's true that the extent of coupling would make it necessary to rewrite of the codebase when trying to replace the framework, but since your code is anyways driven by it, the replacement would require a lot of effort with either of the approaches.

Cons:

\- Code is tightly coupled to the framework. Tomorrow if you want to replace the framework, you would need to rewrite the application

\- It would take more effort to onboard new developers onto the codebase

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, which approach would you all favor, and why?

One of the ideas that stuck with me is the 🚀 **Entrepreneur** &amp; 🎓 **Professor** leadership model.

People in a team need guidance all the time on choosing **speed** vs **quality**. This creates a healthy conflict, because you want to strike balance 🧘 between pushing to deliver and building technical excellence.

But this conflict stays healthy only as long as you have separate people championing each of these qualities.

hello ppl

im a korean currently serving in the korean army (because of the country's mandatory enlistment). im also enrolled in a US college; i finished my sophomore year then took four semesters of leave of absences. my majors related to this subreddit i guess. i want to get into software engineering in the future, or at least out of grad.

im not entirely sure what kind if swe i want to do, but now i have three ish more months till im done w the service. i wanted to make use of this time to prepare myself for school, and perhaps a swe related job in the summer. ive taken 6ish classes related to software development/db management/data structures etc. of course, i forgot them cuz the last time i took classes was spring 2019.

what should i do for the remaining three months? i bought 'cracking the coding interview' and also have bunch of lecture notes from a class called 'principles of imperative computing 15122'

what else should i do in addition/in place of studying the book/going over the notes?

,SoftwareEngineering,"We took a deep dive into making the Spotify model work with Jonathan Rasmusson, former Spotify employee, and author of Competing with Unicorns.

 Here are a few key takeaways from the interview: 

**1. It's easy to copy the Spotify model** 

We all know about squads, tribes, guilds, and so on, but that's just scratching the surface. You need the soul of the model.

**2. Management is the soul** 

You need to change your approach to management to make the Spotify model work. The old school enterprise style management won't cut it.

**3. Empowerment and trust**

This is what management needs to provide its teams. Give your teams ownership of their work, and both your customers and your employees will be grateful. The former for a great product, the latter for a great workplace.

 **4. Sounds good!**

Just one question: how do I make it happen?

Servant leadership is essential to this, but there is so much to it, there's really no point to get into the details here.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi community, I hope this is the right place to post this.

Many years ago my father, who is a medic, asked if I could build a program to facilitate scheduling shifts whit his colleagues. At the time I was still a high school student and didn't know anything about algorithms. So I just smiled, said 'sure' and nothing happened.

During my 4th year in university I went to a course on advanced software engineering where meta heuristics took the biggest chunk of the course. It gave the the notions I needed to create that software.

The principle was easy enough: give each doctor a number of point, then spend them to allocate the shifts. I used a genetic algorithm (with the Java Jenetics library). In a weekend I had a working prototype. It was so good he actually used it for a few months, then we stopped.

The reason is that it would take me a full day of work to input all the information in form of filling variables in the code, for the whole team! I could do it for a few times but then it became clear I needed to code an interface. But couple laziness with poor git usage and I lost all the code and the willingness to rewrite the program.

This last year I did it. The program is spectacular. I wrote it from scratch using much more advanced techniques and using Variable Neighborhood Search instead of genetic algorithms. Since it's based on linear algebra it can even run on accelerated hardware. I even created a mobile first interface that is very intuitive and and I could verify that it was quick and practical to input your preferences.

Then COVID19 came and shifts started to be enforced by the local government so I don't have a market anymore so to speak.

I estimated that, since more than 4% of the people in the world work on a shift basis, the market is actually several hundred millions of worker who could be interested in making their job easier. If you think about it, it's impossible even for a computer to optimally solve this problem even for medium sized teams.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I'm writing this post to seek some career advise as I've been feeling lost and lack of motivation for a while now. I don't know where to start and just get to issue I'm facing. I was hired as a fresher by a well known Multinational Company for the role of Software Development Engineer. Considering the reputation of the brand in the market I expected to learn a lot during my tenure but when the project was assigned to us and all the freshers were assigned their respective roles, the majority of the work I was given dealt with End-to-end automation and Software testing. I was disappointed at first but decided to stick to the role to learn whatever I could in the project and request for a switch of work assignment down the line. It's been an year and the management has refused to change the work assignment. I've finally come to my senses that I can't hurt my career anymore and I need to do something in order to switch my company and my role asap. I've been browsing through every possible material online in order to get started somewhere, but the more I research the more stuck and hopeless I feel.

I really need some useful advice at this point as I'm eager to change and work on myself but I don't know how to get started.

,SoftwareEngineering,"TLDR: I am building a project that allow you to continuously contribute back to the project whatever new things you have learned related to certain career path. (I choose data science related fields) This will allow me to incrementally improve upon the project.

&amp;#x200B;

for more details see below.

When learning new things, I have found myself building small one time projects. The problem with this approach is that small project cannot grow organically to become larger. As a result, I come up with a project that have this properties of growing organically from contributing new things I have learn by building smaller project.

This naturally lead to the following question: what should be my life long project? I figure this out by research all of the jobs positions description related to a range of jobs that I am currently interested in and jobs that I can be easily transitioned from one to another. (data engineer, database manager, data warehousing, data science, data analysist, data architect. ) After a few week of digging, I figured out the life long project idea. The life long project idea for data science related fields must have the following components:

1. Data Scrapper: data must be available online, and data must be frequently updated.
2. Data Pipeline: data pipeline must be large enough, so I can use certain tools which only make sense for larger projects.
3. Data Warehouse: ways to store unstructure data after data is scrapped.
4. Database: ways to store structure data to be analyzed
5. Data Analysis: use data to create report. (which will result in blog post or somethings.)
6. Data science: The project must allow for ""data driven"" approach.

This way, I can treat the project as Port and Adapter architecture where new technologies that I learn can be either adapter or port which only change implementation and does not need to interact with design + logic inside the main codebase.

The project will follow best practices + carefully design/implementation choice.

I mentioned about properties + component of data science life long project. Now what I am missing is I also needs a small team that will allow me to be better team members. This is the reason I created this post to see if anyone maybe interested in working with me. Ultimately, I want the project to allow for smaller team to work on different part of the project. For example, if you are interested in learning about data engineer, then you will get involving with building data pipeline. If you interested in data science, then you will get involve in using the data from database to analyze things.

,SoftwareEngineering,"TL;DR: I’m having a hard time finding a job coming from an Electrical Engineering background into software development so I’m looking to have a serious discussion for career advisory.

I am an Electrical Engineer at heart (BSc and MSc) that recently decided to change my career into software development. I was never much into programming, I used Matlab and VBA a lot in school and in some jobs as well. But on my last job, I started using Python and Django at the same time that I was learning it and it actually grew on me so I dove deep into learning it for good. Unfortunately, corona hit the company I worked for and I was let go. So I decided to boost my skills and started taking courses to learn more and more Python, Django, REST APIs, SQL, some data structures and algorithms theory, and even software development (Agile methodology and so on).

Even though I think I have a lot to give and I’m doing great progress on learning it all too fast, I’m finding it hard to get a job (and interviews) by not having a lot of professional experience or a Computer Science degree. Because when I see the requirements for most of the job postings I think to myself that it would take years to acquire all those skills and still no professional experience and by then, all the stack will probably have changed again.

So lately I’ve been a bit lost and wondering if I’m doing the right thing. Is this the best way to approach the problem? Or maybe I should consider getting a proper CS degree? What would be the real benefits of it? Or should I just keep putting all my efforts into separate courses, tutorials, and small personal projects?

Anyway, I hope I can raise a healthy discussion on this topic.",t2_2a1sr7gd,False,,0,False,Career advisory for an Electrical Engineer wanting to become a Software Engineer,[],r/SoftwareEngineering,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_jagxgd,False,dark,0.9,,public,14,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,14,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1602635441.0,text,6,,,text,self.SoftwareEngineering,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: I’m having a hard time finding a job coming from an Electrical Engineering background into software development so I’m looking to have a serious discussion for career advisory.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey fellow engineers,

Recently I got confused when speaking with my manager. When discussing my career he/she very often mention that this or that project has **higher visibility** than other projects - thus depending my promotion/growth on working with such project(s) even if my expertise is somewhere else (e.g. being expert in architecture but contributing to new FrontEnd design).

**I'd like to ask you if it is normal to evaluate engineers (performance, promotion) by the Business impact of a project they contributed to?** 

In big organisations, one engineer may be in project that makes millions of dollars and still write mediocre code, while another person can work e.g. on CMS system, deliver great code/product, but CMS on it's own does not generate revenue (it's an auxiliary system).

,SoftwareEngineering,"From a person who has been self taught and find myself not knowing the basics sometimes - don't worry. Look we are quick learners and we love this field because it makes us solve problems and look at things ins a cool perspective.

So yeah at work it gets hard when we have to learn what seems like 1000 things whilst juggling tickets or story points or whatever. Remember we love the problem and we love that resolution feeling. 

So don't forget to take care of yourself and even take time off to remember why we do what we do. I took a step back today and looked at all I've learnt in the last 4 years (from barely coding a good for loop - to interviewing new candidates for my team.) Don't lose that passion and yes we need to learn and it's stupidly stressful when you aren't comfortable and need to still implement new things. 

Never feel like the imposter - unless you're playing among us.

Remember how far you've gone - especially when you feel overwhelmed.

And lastly we made open source a thing so don't forget that we **want** to help each other and we will do ! So if you feel lost or alone reach out to the community and maybe you'll wake up next morning with an email or a notification of someone giving you the next steps or enlightenment on a problem

I'm back in the game after taking some time off from work (family stuff).


I'm a backend with 8 years of experience, and I want to try and interview to the top tech companies (Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Fb, Apple).

now I can take a month to prepare myself for those notorious job interviews.


There is a structured TODO list that i can go over it to prepare myself to those interview?

I'm taking mainly on the technical parts but there are some tricky questions in the ""tell me 3 bad things about you"" parts as well.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello Everyone,

I have been self-teaching programming for more or less 18 months. I have been so far unsuccessful to land a junior developer position. I did in fact land a junior position but was let go after two weeks for not being technical enough and lacking a lot of skills (even though they knew this but anyway). I have been advised by my mum's friend who is a software engineer for me to complete a Software Engineering Degree. He said that I would greatly benefit from some ""formal training"" I am half tempted as I feel all these hours I am investing into self-teaching are all for nothing and I feel as if I am not going anywhere fast I am 25 about to turn 26 and feel the time is passing me by and I need to act now, If I was to join the course I would have some formal training and a degree at the end of it which could then land me a graduate role.

He asked me to add him to LinkedIn. Which I did, next I receive a question regarding my profile and get blocked by him.

This is a place where high-level topics are discussed, think not of frameworks, stacks, cloud services but architecture, design paradigms, management practices, etc.

* Always follow the [reddiquette](/wiki/reddiquette) 
* This subreddit is for software engineering-related content in general; try to be ""vague"" with the specific technology you are using. Software engineering deals with higher-level topics and abstractions.
* Do not publish career questions; career questions belong to r/cscareerquestions.
* You can publish your own content if it goes through the moderation team first, and if it's tasteful, we won't allow posts from accounts that ONLY publish their own content, publish low-effort posts, and cross-post to every subreddit that's just a bit related.

#Post Rules

* The following thread types require mod approval: surveys and AMAs (sharing survey results are fine).
* Low-effort, homework help, ""looking to interview."" posts are not allowed.
* Don't ask for career advice; go to r/cscareerquestions for that.
* Posts that ask solely about learning materials or resources do not belong here (e.g., ""What is the best book for learning X?"", ""How do I set up a website on a Y stack?"", etc.). Those questions should be redirected to the resources of /r/learnprogramming or a subreddit specific to a language/technology.
* Low-effort posts without much context or details will probably be deleted. Posts with no body text will likely be considered too vague and will be removed.
* If your post doesn't actually have a question, it'd better have significant material worth discussing. Threads that consist of just a link, or have a link with minimal accompanying text, are not allowed. Please put effort into setting up the discussion.
* Do not ask for hardware advice; there are already many other places where someone can help you with your PC build based on your needs.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi r/SoftwareEngineering!

I'm curious what your development database environment looks like?

I noticed [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/n6eged/do_you_prefer_shared_database_or_local_when/) in r/Database which revealed quite a few folks using shared development databases, whereas some clearly prefer their own local copies.

I wonder if this community has different opinions?

I must admit I was a bit surprised to see as many responses about using shared environments. I've heard from others (and experienced myself) that these shared instances can easily end up changing beneath your feet without you realising and causing all sorts of problems. Schema changes getting applied that conflict with your own, data disappearing or changing unexpectedly, etc. How prevalent are these in your day-to-day?

My other questions for those of you who do use a **local environment** is how is it set up?

* Is it running in a container via something like Docker?
* Is it your own instance in a cloud hosted environment?
* Have you installed the engine itself as a native service on your machine?
* Is it setup entirely differently?
* How large is it? Is it a copy of production? Generated test data?

,SoftwareEngineering,"I have seen this problem in a couple of projects/companies I was part of:

First when you start the project you setup a staging and a production system and everything works fine. You develop your feature on your local machine, push it to staging, the product owner (or whoever) tests it on staging and if everything is fine, it is deployed to production.

If the team is getting bigger and bigger it happens more often that one developer deploys feature A on staging and developer wants to deploy feature B to staging. But she can not deploy it because it takes some time for feature A being tested/reviewed. 

So staging is occupied by one feature which suspends the development of another feature.

In our projects we than either build a second staging system called ""preview"" or ""demo"". Which solved the problem for a while, but if you grow more you will get the same problem. 

Or one time on of our developers tried to create a ""lab"" infrastructure where every branch would get its own running system. After 8 months of work the lab infrastructure still was not working like we wanted it (because often other things became more important and work on ""lab"" was postponed a lot) we gave up on the lab infrastructure.

How do you manage this kind of development infrastructure? How do you give your developers the ability to have a running demo environment of her branch to do quality assurance or show to stakeholders?

(For context: I am not using serverless or other fancy new stuff. I am mostly working on classic web applications that have grown over at least 5 years and have a backend running an API and a frontend that talks to the API over HTTP (and also some asynchronous worker processes on the backend for long running stuff)

&lt;p&gt;First when you start the project you setup a staging and a production system and everything works fine. You develop your feature on your local machine, push it to staging, the product owner (or whoever) tests it on staging and if everything is fine, it is deployed to production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the team is getting bigger and bigger it happens more often that one developer deploys feature A on staging and developer wants to deploy feature B to staging. But she can not deploy it because it takes some time for feature A being tested/reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So staging is occupied by one feature which suspends the development of another feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our projects we than either build a second staging system called &amp;quot;preview&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;demo&amp;quot;. Which solved the problem for a while, but if you grow more you will get the same problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or one time on of our developers tried to create a &amp;quot;lab&amp;quot; infrastructure where every branch would get its own running system. After 8 months of work the lab infrastructure still was not working like we wanted it (because often other things became more important and work on &amp;quot;lab&amp;quot; was postponed a lot) we gave up on the lab infrastructure. We killed it.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"**TL**;**DR:** How do you structure the transactional messages (email, sms, etc) sending service in your software?

&amp;#x200B;

How do you handle sending messages in your system (emails, sms’s, whatsapp, telegram, etc) to your clients? I already have the necessary apis integrated, I’m wondering how to build the system so it’s flexible and scalable. 

What I'm looking for are personal experiences about dealing with more complex messages systems, dealing with 100+ messages templates that are constantly being changed by the marketing department.

Where would be a good place to store the templates? (we have most of them in .html and .txt files inside the ""server build"" and some in the database). Would an Aws s3 bucket be a better place?

And how to schedule messages after X time? For example, a patient has an appointment after 7 days and 3 hours. We are using Aws sqs queues but it doesn't work very well, and the only alternative I can think involves a database table and a cron job which might be even worse.

How to structure the code? For example, right now we have a cron called BirthdayJob that calls

`TouchpointGateway.sendBirthdayMessage(Patient patient)`

`{`

`EmailService.sendBirthday(patient);`

`SmsService.sendBirthday(patient);`

`WhatsApp.sendBirthday(patient);`

`}`

I am a college student who has to study software design this term. I am pretty new to software design but admire its power a lot.

I really want to study software design, but every time I show my class diagrams to my teacher, he always tells me that my class diagram was wrong without showing any reasons.

I really want to improve this skill to draw class diagram and other diagrams, but can't depend on my current teacher.

Are there any books or courses that could help me develop this skill?

Can I learn the design of other systems that currently working on the Internet, like reverse engineering?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey,

Sorry in advance if this post is all over the place.I'll break it into points, so I can explain it as clearly as possible.

# My background

I've been programming for 13 years, out of which 3 were commercial (employment, contracts) - the rest were on and off freelance or opensource work.I'm currently employed as a mid-tier software engineer specializing in .NET, Vue, and GraphQL - but **I was also told I'll be promoted to senior engineer** by the end of the year, as soon as I gain more insight into the products we're building.

# The issue

Now, here's the issue - **because I'll be a senior engineer,** I'll be more hands-on when it comes to architecture. In fact, it was made clear to me that a few of the projects will be started and led by me, **so knowledge about proper design patterns and architecture could be a great benefit.**

Because of all that, I've started reading up on DDD, CQRS, Microservices, CAP Theorem, and all the related.. - and while **I understand the premise, I can't apply them to my projects.**

I've had no issue building microservices in the past and I realize they require at least basic knowledge of DDD and CQRS to successfully define bounding contexts and implement communication between services - but I've always done it by intuition (it just felt ""right"").

.. but now, when I'm trying to work on my own relatively simple microservices project and try to apply DDD on the service level (having proper layers: Application, Infrastructure, Domain) - I just get into **the infinite loop** and get to a point where I have a folder structure, get irritated and then start remaking it over and over again - it also doesn't help that I have **OCPD**.

I don't know if it's the right place to ask, but I would greatly benefit from a mentor that I could ask now and then whether my structure or implementation is well within the definition of DDD and/or CQRS.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Let's say in your frontend user interface, the user interacts with an object (json object) and you need that object to always be in sync with the backend object (stored in the DB)

A straighforward answer would be that whenever the user does a change to that object you have to call your API backend to save it.

But then:

How do you handle the case when saving the object fails? When that happens, the UI and backend are no longer in sync since the change already happened in the UI but not committed to the database.

How do you handle the case where the save doesn't just store the object as it is coming from the frontend but needs to do some modifications to it? When that happens, the changes made in the backend are not in sync with what the user sees in the frontend.

Considered solution:

Have the backend return the object as it is in the database when the save succeeds or fails so that the UI can use that value to revert back the UI state in case of failure or update the UI in case of success.

But this just does sound very clean to me, in case of failure returning the full object doesnt sound like good practice in addition to having to return message errors. And in case of success it feels overkill to have to rerender the whole UI using the updated object whenever a change is made.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey everyone,

Imagine this: a team where you don’t have to hold anybody’s hand. A team that delivers results with you only minimally getting involved in the frontline work.

It's not a dream.

Weeks ago we had an exciting chat with Mike Seavers (ex-CTO at Riot Games) about building self-managed teams. He shared all the tips and tricks you need to know. He’s working hard to implement the lessons he’s learned over the years.  


**Here are some key takeaways from the interview:**

1. What does the manager do in a self-managing team?

The leader’s job is to coach. You don’t do the frontline work anymore, so you shouldn’t make all the frontline decisions. Your job is to teach your direct reports to solve problems and think for themselves.

2. There are reasons not to build an autonomous team

Leaders often have a desire to get to the frontline and do the work. Making decisions for your team is often quicker than having them take time to consider those decisions carefully. However, you come out ahead in the long run by letting these go.

3. Communicate your expectations

Let your reports know that you expect them to think for themselves. You can turn it into a company-wide initiative or you can work individually with certain people. Just be straightforward, and give them space to actually do it.

4. Coach your reports instead of deciding for them

When your reports are making a decision, let them know you expect them to come to you with a suggestion. Help them think it through by reminding them of the goals and pointing out potential flaws. They’ll pick up on the process quickly.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Wish you to clarify something, dear fellows.

Imagine that you have two UseCases.

One of them is **CreateCustomerHandler**, other is **SignUpCustomerByGoogleAuthHandler**. So, the **SignUpCustomerByGoogleAuthHandler** has to reuse the **CreateCustomerHandler** to eventually create a **Customer**.

Is it legit to inject **CreateCustomerHandler** to **SignUpCustomerByGoogleAuthHandler** as a dependency? Are there any pitfalls?

Read that it's not recommended to reuse your UseCases, but what to do in that simple case? Extract the whole **CreateCustomerHandler** as **Application Service** and inject it both to the **CreateCustomerHandler** and **SignUpCustomerByGoogleAuthHandler** UseCases?

Is reject considered an error state in a promise, or just a general &amp;quot;the promise could not be fulfilled&amp;quot;? I don&amp;#39;t want to rewrite it using flow control but just with promises, so my other solution would just be to return null or something which is explicitly checked.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering," 

While studying design patterns, I found the following questions in a textbook, and I am having a hard time figuring out the answers.

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Re-use an existing class but provide new functionality.**

I believe this could be the Decorator pattern: you can wrap the existing class in another one that provides new functionality.

**2. Be able to replace the implementation of an interface at runtime.**

Here, the ""run-time"" requirement is really giving me a headache. I think this could be the Strategy Design pattern, because it allows for a client to ask the Context which strategy implementation to use. However, the ""run-time replacement"" feels a bit of a stretch here.

**3. Extend the functionality of objects dynamically during runtime.**

Again, the ""runtime"" requirement feels problematic to me. I could argue that the Decorator extends the functionality of objects, and if you have written all the Decorators you need you can pick one of them at run-time.

**4. Decouple clients of a system X from dependencies on subsystems of X.**

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi, I'm a computer science msc student from scandinavia. I'm 24 years old. 

I've been programming, and just generally being a computer geek for 4 years now. 

Like most other software developers, I've been hit by imposter syndrome, having a feeling that I should now more technical stuff than I do. Also like most programmers, I have some areas in which i'm pretty proud of my skills, and then I have some areas, where my skills are lacking.

The other day, I had a meeting with some co-students, that I am doing a project with, and while doing some programming on our project while screensharing. When I had to do the commit, I first committed, and then I pulled, and boom I had a merge conflict. Most of the time, I have no idea how to solve merge conflicts. I've read a few guides which never seem to work. I ended up deleting the project and cloning again in front of everyone. Super embarrassing.

&amp;#x200B;

So, for me, git is one of those topics that I have never really been taught, and I'm not a 100% on doing it properly.

Another topic that I for some reason am just kinda behind on, is low level languages, and generally low-level stuff. Stuff like knowing what a register is memory pointers,, and how the stack really works behind the curtain.

,SoftwareEngineering," ""It will create a huge mess. What were they thinking?""

The instructions were specific. Copy this column into a new column. If we need a join, then use the new column. Allow the original one to be edited. Reason? Well, because the customer wants it shown in their language.

Trouble was, the original was a primary key. Used for joins all over the code base. Database, services, backend logic, config files... We were looking at enormous maintenance and testing impact.

Whoever had come up with this solution, obviously did not understand this.

Here's the trouble with prescribing a solution like a spec. It's like a one-way hash. It encrypts the customer's needs into software features. But features will not tell you WHY they need it.

Did they really need exactly THIS column to be editable? We pushed back and digged deeper. Turns out no. They just want the frontend to show it in a different language. They did not care which column we use.

When you understand both the customer's needs AND the code base, you'll often end up with slightly different features. And a vastly more efficient implementation.

Inexperienced developers will follow the ""letter of the law"", and make (usually wrong) assumptions about customer needs. And they won't realize the long-term consequences until it's too late.

Experienced engineers will push back with ""why do it THIS way?"". Or, ""this will cause problem X, Y and Z"". They're not being negative. They're doing their job.

In the end, the smarter solution was simply to abstract the DISPLAY of this column into one central piece of code. This logic would then check a second column to see if there was an edit. If yes, display that, otherwise use the original. Primary key left untouched.

HUGE cost saving.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello,  
I'm working on a macroservices (sane microservices as people call it) project and I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around an issue related to DDD.  


In a typical DDD project, you would have 3 layers: Application Layer (AL), Domain Layer (DL), and Infrastructure Layer (IL).

According to major sources on DDD - by default, the dependencies should look like this:  


[Dependencies in DDD](https://preview.redd.it/ml34ox2j4iz61.png?width=303&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=219460dfad8c1b8745befafcd3d01919a6325e86)

This makes sense:  
\- AL is usually an API that gets data or spins logic in DL  
\- IL is storage for POCO's contained in DL  
\- DL is just plain business logic.  
Now, the issues I'm having are - I'm using .NET, GraphQL, and Entity Framework Core (EFCore) for this project.

GraphQL allows sorting, filtering, and pagination of records, among with being able to fetch nested (related) entities with ease - provided it's connected to a queryable source, like `IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;`.  
This generates the #1 issue I have because it enforces that methods in my DL return `IQueryable&lt;TEntity&gt;` as opposed to my POCO's which aren't queryable.  
So, the dependency chart immediately looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/cloy4l8y9iz61.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6218f47badca3f24cc5cb2365132134b6e2e80f

EFCore allows putting together multiple queries into a single query - thus reducing simultaneous database calls to one and improving performance greatly.  
This generates the #2 issue I have because it enforces that in order to make use of that feature - I have to write the logic in my methods around EFCore's `DbSet&lt;TEntity&gt;` instead of my POCO's.  
So, in this case, the dependency chart would change to this:

In both cases, the shape of DL and its logic has to adhere to AL or IL - which I consider anti-DDD.

The core folder contains business logic, that uses the models in the model folder to manipulate the models, get data from databases etc.

The ""api"" folder contains the code that exposes the core functionalityt, and creates endpoints for the api.

The two test folders just contain tests for the two other folders.

This seems fairly generic, but can anyone tell me if there is a pattern that corresponds to this type of pattern?

I know how to combine the individual orders to create Plans. But **my challenge is how do I update the plan id on respective individual deliveries in real time?**

All the plans and deliveries are stored as Azure collections. I think I should be using a event based stream processing system to update the **plan id on the deliveries** and vice versa in real time. I belive Kafka could be used to achieve above goals but I don't have any prior experience of working on distributed systems. Are there any design patterns that could help me solve this problem.

Each individual delivery is (for now) represented as a pair of two times viz. &lt;strong&gt;pickup&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;drop off&lt;/strong&gt; (estimated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know how to combine the individual orders to create Plans. But &lt;strong&gt;my challenge is how do I update the plan id on respective individual deliveries in real time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the plans and deliveries are stored as Azure collections. I think I should be using a event based stream processing system to update the &lt;strong&gt;plan id on the deliveries&lt;/strong&gt; and vice versa in real time. I belive Kafka could be used to achieve above goals but I don&amp;#39;t have any prior experience of working on distributed systems. Are there any design patterns that could help me solve this problem. The system has to be low latency because the volume of orders is very high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I solve this challenge? any insight would be really helpful. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello and I hope you're feeling well.

I'm   a fairly novice engineer and my experience with attempting to build   microservices has been plagued with the following problems:

1. Request/Response   for service communication with a 'n' number of services has often led   to a huge ball of a system with n:n message connections.
2. Introducing   an event driven style meant adding a layer of indirection (message   queue, event log), complexity in logic in terms of aggregation and   sequencing, and the emergent behavior of the system becoming harder to   ""learn"" and understand.
3. A   gradual loss of abstraction as new business requirements often lead to   having to share/fetch state between services AND a gradual muddling of   initially defined service responsibilities.

Any advice would be appreciated but I do have more specific questions if that may help:

1. How to design service boundaries and responsibilities that will endure new business requirements?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Please note, I'm talking about ""*engineering* manager"", not ""manager"" or ""project manager"".

Whenever there's a discussion about management in software there are hundreds different opinions and ideas. More often than not, it is said that managers shouldn't code, that they should lead and grow people, etc. Sounds great....but here how I observe theory mismatch reality.

Problem 1) When engineering manager can't differentiate ""good job done"" vs ""job done"".

Simple situation, team delivers, tech debt piles up, engineering manager was so non-tech and never looked under the hood. At first glance project looks ok, but under the hood it's crap. In meantime team members got appraised/promoted based on delivery (because the appraising authority - the engineering manager himself - was not able to spot lack of internal quality). And be honest, it's very easy to ""fake"" quality at initial stage of the project.

Problem 2) When engineering manager don't understand the tech stack good enough how he/she can help individual grow?

Example, an engineering manager who used to be Java BackEnd developer, now managing a team with iOS mobile developer. How such engineering manager can spot all the small details required to be improved in order to make a person senior iOS engineer? For me it sounds like placing volleyball coach to be a basketball coach (will work on basic levels, but never volleyball coach will be able to spot all the small details that makes great basketball player).

,SoftwareEngineering,"(cross posted in r/legal but thought I'd ask here too )

Context:
==========

I work at a healthcare insurance company. There are Accessibility compliance rules that our websites have to follow. 

The rule is that a ""reputable"" third-party Accessibility evaluation company will give a certification that our websites are up-to-par with the Accessibility rules stipulated by the government (called 508 compliance).

We (my team especially) dealt with a very shitty 3rd party company. So we switched to a better one, but waaay too costly.

While dealing with the shitty one my team and I had to actually do the actual work fixing the accessibility, and thus I gained a lot of insight in doing this right. I had to learn WCAG /ARIA rules because of how shitty the third party vendor was.

Also doing ARIA changes are really annoying to software developers, but I am weird in that I kinda like it.

So while learning all this I found out that there's a free MIT-licensed open-source engine (https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa) that can automate some of the ARIA assessment. 

IDEA:
============

So, I thought I could be the company that my employer needs. I can offer a mid-level service that is better than the shitty one we use, and cheaper than the best one in the market. 

The service will be white-gloved so I'll also do code changes and work with design changes too, going beyond just finding accessibility issues but fixing them too.

I'll also offer continuous evaluation of the site and alert them when accessibility falls out.


My Concerns
===========

Certification has to be coming from an independent third party accessibility assessment company. I wouldn't be completely independent.

However there isn't really any way to lie about accessibility compliance - you either have website that has it or doesn't have it.  So, my potential new company's certification is on the line if accessibility is out of compliance. This is especially true involving auditing public-facing websites.

What I'm more concerned is perhaps even offering this service might look bad on me and be on the crosshairs of my direct manager of potential people that can be let go. Or even gain envy of others and have that reflect as having a bad working environment.


QUESTION:
===========

Sure the right answer is ""don't do it"". However my quesion is - if I were to do it - what would the steps be to secure myself and my assets? How would I approach my current company in offering this service?

,SoftwareEngineering,"I recently posted about an issue with an asymmetric team with one if the issues of having a ""hyper-performer"". I just wanted to touch on this topic a bit, why I used this term.

Let me start with a hyper-performer to me doesn't mean something intrinsic. They are just very good at what they do in the specific environment in which they do it. Now that I got that out of the way, I would like to respond to some areas of discussion.

1. They're fast/cranking out code: In my situation, this is not the case at all. The person I was discussing is actually very slow at development. They can take 2-4 times longer to do a project and 10 times longer if that project involves a system that they never worked in. In the sense of what they do, they are very slow, one of the slowest.
2. They make complex systems, they should make them simpler: That's the issue. They're dealing with complex problems and they are making the system reasonably simple without being simplistic. They actually have a knack for cleaning up other people's code and simplifying it. Many people and teams tend to organically grow their feature creep iteratively until the system becomes so complex that they can no longer support it. Either as bug fixes or feature enhancements. This person can usually re-factor the design and code in such a way that there is much less code and the code is easier to follow.
3. They should better define the projects so that others can better work on them without need gross levels of feedback or to always pair: This goes back to the complexity of the problems at hand. The projects themselves are generally small, but with innumerable edge cases that need to be handled with a combination of explicit design and implementation. It is common for a story to be something like 2 weeks of design and 3 days of coding. And if the person who's doing the coding doesn't understand the meaning of the design requirements. I've seen failing projects that entire teams spent man-years working on, and this person took over, spend about 1 month doing nothing but thinking, then cranked out a few thousand lines of code in a week and was done. Shipped and never touched the project again, been running for years in heavy use.
4. Performance is relative to the company, could be a bad company: Very possible. I don't claim that we have the best in the industry for engineering skills like a Google or Netflix. But we are an industry leader and over half of our engineers have been working with the company for 10-20 years and we recently went on a hiring spree, so that percentage used to be larger. We have very low turn-over and everyone is very friendly. I should also mention that we've even partnered with Google, Microsoft, and some other large companies because they desire our expertise. And all of them backed out of attempting to do what we do because it's so difficult. To be clear, Googles want a mostly hands-off system. Our problem domain is fundamentally very hands-on, and designing our systems to deal with minimizing support while handling edge cases is a difficult problem. We have to embrace failure and streamline the process to either allow the customer to fix it themselves or for the system to clearly communicate the problem in a proactive manner. Googles excel at having employees with immense technical skills in a wide range of computer science related issues. We excel at employees having deep domain understanding and expertise. Several of our largest projects were actually required by law for a company, and when they went to our competitors, they all turned them down. They came to us in desperation and we(as a company) almost turned them down, but this one person felt confident and pulled it off as they lead the project and implemented many of the systems nearly solo. &lt;-- we're stopping this practice going forward
5. Troubleshooting, doing what specialists can't: I've been at the company for a long while and one of the feats this person pulled off was with a firewall appliance issue. We had a $500,000 firewall setup that came with a support contract. One day we had an issue with a customer claiming their HTTPS connection was faulting to our web API. This was a big customer with many millions in contracts riding on this working. The first few days Ops, network services, architects, and principal and lead engineers were scrambling to figure this out. Once they hit their end of their rope, they called in for the support contract. The firewall vendor sent some people over. They spent another several days trying to figure it out. Then the firewall vendor reached out to a 3rd-party that also so happens to sell support services for their appliance. Flew them out across country to us. Spent another several days. By this time there was a near 24/7 meeting-room full of people going in and out with everyone and their laptops in there, and people in the datacenter trying to sniff traffic and other things. This ""hyper-performer"" flagged down the VP of operations as they walked passed and asked about what was going on. The VP humored them and forwarded the original email sent by the customer describing the issue, and nothing else. This person sat there for several hours staring at the wall, then suddenly got up and wanted to run something past me. Stated a few facts as known by what the customer said, then made a bunch of assumptions based on what everyone else probably already checked out. He then proceeded to state a bunch of axioms that I agreed to for sake of argument. Then led me down a trail of eliminating areas where the issue could be occurring based on those axioms and assumptions. And in the remaining areas, he started listing off possibilities and likelihoods.  Finished with what they thought was the most likely cause and a test to falsify it. They're not very fast about things, but they described how to test this in enough detail that I was able to script some stuff and not only reproduce the issue on demand, which is more than what anyone else could do, but also fit their conjecture as to why this is happening. We went to the meeting room and pulled someone out to explain what kind of setting they would be looking for. That person went back to the room and relayed the information. About 30 minutes later they confirmed it fixed the issue. This is their ability in a nutshell. They don't exactly do things ""faster"" than people, they do things that other people can't do. With the understanding that ""can't"" is a continuum. The closer to ""can't"" people get, the faster this person is relative to them. Given a large enough company, there is always something that someone ""can't"" do and this person has a full time job dealing with ""complex"" projects.

People: Stop treating us like replaceable cogs

Also people: 10x doesn't exist, anyone can do what they do aka we're replaceable cogs

Sorry for this wall of text, but I think we're entering an age where we need to start recognizing unique abilities that people have and not treating everyone like a replaceable cog. A team of people compliment each other, not only because they work together, but because they fill in talent gaps for each other.

When people say there aren't ""10x"" programmers, I call BS. People are looking for gods that can do anything and everything. That is not the case. They are people that seem to have a unique ability that if used correctly, greatly benefit others. Stop looking for a person that is 10x faster and look for a person who makes 100 people 10% faster. 10% faster can be gained by increased performance or reduced support.  In many cases they may be more like a one-trick-pony.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi everyone, msc computer science student here.

I'm currently taking a course in software architecture, and I have to do an assignment where I should derive some architectural view/model from a preexisting system.

It's rather freeform, I can decide for my myself what language the target application/system should be written in. It's also completely up to myself whether to use a tool (for example one that could automatically create a module view model).

Using the view that I derive, I then have to say something clever about the application. Like, maybe there are some anti-patterns, maybe it is made using conflicting architectural methods etc...

I think I want to do a python application, and write the code for analysis myself. But i'm locked in on it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, i'm looking for some good idea's for metrics and view's that I could use to say something meaningfull about a application. Something creative!

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my tentative ideas are stuff like looking for code duplication, warnings regarding overly complicated controller methods, and maybe something as simple as measuring lines of code.

I could also use a graph drawing library to draw a graph of all the modules. 

At this point i'm still in the early phases, and are trying to squeeze my mind for measureable things, that  I can use my view to say something meaningfull about the state of the application.

I would be really interested in good ideas. I'm not looking for anyone to do my homework for me, but rather just some creative inspiration. Or maybe some metrics that are just a bit different and unexpected

,SoftwareEngineering,"So all the sources I have are either very short or very ""words words words"" on this without any examples. I want to make sure I understand the concept behind this so I'll give you my understanding and we'll work from there.

So the way I understand SOA is that you design software using services that already exist so you don't have to design and implement them yourself. Your job is to link them together to create working software.

For example: We build a webpage. We use paypal for payment processing. Is that an example of SOA? I just integrate that on my webpage and I'll build whatever is necessary to make it work on my end. In this example:

Paypal would be the service provider. They implement the whole payment processing on their end. Who would be the service broker? Is my webpage the service consumer (because my webpage uses that service)?

If my example is correct, I have a few questions still: Why is scalability a big thing in the conext of SOA? All I do is delegate stuff to someone else? How does my webpage scale well because of that? Isn't the service provider the one to worry about scalability? Because all I would do is to link the services together.

Isn't the interoperability aspect just that I link these two together?

I want to make sure I understand the concept behind this so I&amp;#39;ll give you my understanding and we&amp;#39;ll work from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the way I understand SOA is that you design software using services that already exist so you don&amp;#39;t have to design and implement them yourself. Your job is to link them together to create working software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: We build a webpage. We use paypal for payment processing. Is that an example of SOA? I just integrate that on my webpage and I&amp;#39;ll build whatever is necessary to make it work on my end. In this example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paypal would be the service provider. They implement the whole payment processing on their end. Who would be the service broker? Is my webpage the service consumer (because my webpage uses that service)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If my example is correct, I have a few questions still: Why is scalability a big thing in the conext of SOA? All I do is delegate stuff to someone else? How does my webpage scale well because of that? Isn&amp;#39;t the service provider the one to worry about scalability? Because all I would do is to link the services together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t the interoperability aspect just that I link these two together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Resuability and &amp;quot;loose coupling&amp;quot; aspect is just that I could replace one service for another if I need to, right?&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"I'm in an uncomfortable situation of having a hyper-performer, 3 level 4 engineers, and a level 1 on the same team. The level 1 is having difficultly understanding and contributing to the work the seniors are working on, which is kind of excluding them from participating properly. And when they do participate, their work has to constantly be corrected because the issues are too complex for them. Being relegated to support is not fun.

The issue the Level 1 is having working with the seniors, the seniors are having with the hyper-performer. The hyper-performer has an incredibly low re-work rate which is causing a feed-back loop of leadership routing more and more complex projects to our team. But many of these projects are being routed our way because they're too difficult for other teams. Essentially, our team is overall becoming responsible for an ever growing collection of projects that no one but the hyper-performer completely understands.

A recent attempt that seems to be working. Many of these complex projects are primarily difficult because of the level of research, clean design, defensive safeties, and subtle nuances. A single poor choice can result in huge amounts of re-work, which is why other teams turned them down. This hyper-performer is instead filling out specifications and pair programming. This allows the others to work on the other 90% parts of the projects that they do understand.

Even worse is when the level 1 is pairing with the hyper-performer. While they get along well, the bar for quality is difficult for the seniors to meet. The level  1 just sees pages of suggestions and required changes. Makes them feel inadequate, no matter how nicely delivered.

While this is a great first step, we still have the issue that the important details and deep understanding is still silo'd. Team velocity is up and more participation, but the bus factor is as bad as it has ever been. While all of these wins sound good, the hyper-performer no longer has any work assigned to them, which they don't like. And the team velocity being up is less about the hyper-performer being a bottleneck and more of them improving the performance of everyone else. The velocity of the complex projects are overall down. Leadership is noticing a reduction in the rate of these projects getting done.

Large asymmetries is a difficult problem.

Update 1: After reading these responses, reflecting a bit and bringing it back to the team, the team owning is more important than knocking out specialty projects leadership wants. We are collectively leaning towards them playing a more mentorship and consulting role than they already are. Their ask was that the team explicitly call out that is how they want the team dynamic.

Even if their expertise is lost in the future, at least the team as a whole can maintain status-quo.

A longer term question is how this will apply to performance reviews. In a way they're moving towards a higher position, but in another way they not doing their official responsibilities as defined by their title. I guess more leverage for a promotion.

The short term issue is we're technically down an engineer, which does affect velocity in different ways. Overall win as they help even senior engineers get unblocked, but fewer stories in flight.

Updated 2: One of the misconceptions about this hyper-performer is they're producing a lot. They are not. They are very slow. The issue is the complexity of the projects. They are relatively small projects that require near perfection in  a situation where no one knows what they want, just want they don't want.

It would prevent most of the toil on which the engineers now spend most of their time, impose some consistency on what is now a jumbled mess, and allow us to add new features significantly more quickly.

However, I am reticent because there is no programmatic way of validating the system&amp;#39;s functioning and the manually created code is so inconsistent. Advice?&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"The old joke I was always told in high school was that software *engineering* was going to be 80% of the time just documenting things.

Plot twist: It's about 20%, while 60% of your time is figuring out why the hell none of the tools and 20% is documenting how to run those tools, config files, test machines/software, build scripts, golden retrievers, etc. which aren't working since either the sw is so goddam old or there was never any documentation in the first place and all of this documentation you're doing is to pay it forward to the next intern or bright-eyed new hire that will be replacing you when you inevitably get sick of this job.

In college, occasionally had an issue, but you are almost always given a pretty straight-forward task and a straight-forward way to set up something like SVN so you get a little experience with setting up your workspace tools but you are primarily focused on good design and code.

In an effort to not make this post a complete negative contribution, I will say what would probably help, although feels like a waste of time to many, is more familiarity with such tools, languages, and debugging THAT instead of the code itself even. And I don't mean step-by-step ""How to Set Up Git In 5 Minutes"" like every Youtube video out there, I mean I don't think kids are being taught enough about low-level knowledge so that when the high-level fancy-pants 3-lines-you're-done code doesn't work, they can at least dig in enough to write an intelligible Github issue or even figure out the issue themselves.

Is college or courses supposed to teach you some of that? Yes, but it won't cover everything, but it should definitely cover common industry standards.

For instance, Ant build was always something that just got tucked away in the back of the IDE, in the back of your mind, until you realize there's no point in downloading a 4th IDE (Intellij) on a computer with already full drives of repos just so you can build something when a commandline would do fine. Except despite clear documentation on commandline Ant, there is some sort of needlepoint accuracy you need for getting the right command to work with the right version of Java for said old codebase. /rant

For the most part, it is working. But, our backlog grooming meetings seems to be not very productive.

First problem: it seems more often than not either the architect or product manager miss the meeting.  Some tickets we can't estimate because we have some questions. We can reschedule meetings and all that, but schedules are packed and I hate doing that game. Are there ways to not need the architect and PM? Some sort of async process?  


Second problem: We spend a lot of time asking product questions and product spends a lot of time saying they will update the mocks/reqs. So we are often stuck in limbo with tickets where we can't estimate because of open questions. Should I pre-screen the tickets and get those questions to PM sooner? The problem I see is that I just end grooming the backlog myself.   


Third problem: When we do have enough information to estimate, the estimate still feels shallow. When devs start working on the tickets little details often come up that make the ticket underestimated. Feels like there is not enough time to focus on each ticket.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello, everyone.

I'd like to share my experience switching from frontend to backend development. Feel free to let me know if you've had a similar experience or if you've got some other perspective.

After 4 years of FE development as an Android and iOS engineer at one company, I jumped ship and signed on with another company. My new company had an iOS app and a Node BE. After a few months of working, it became clear the iOS product pipeline was very light. Sensing a strong need for BE developers, I asked my manager if I could slowly start transitioning away to BE.

As time went on, I eventually worked exclusively in BE development. During my 2 years as a BE developer, I successfully transitioned our monolithic architecture to a micro service architecture and rolled out a SaaS product used all around the world.

My general feeling now is that **BE development is a huge pain in the ass** and that it would be much easier to simply be a FE developer. Let me argue my case with some points.

&amp;#x200B;

1. You need to know a TON of technologies and concepts at the same time. In my time at the company I had to learn:
   1. containerization
   2. infrastructure-as-code
   3. SQL
   4. NOSQL
   5. Lambdas
   6. event queues/streaming
   7. authentication
   8. authorization
   9. security
   10. hosting
   11. logging
   12. middleware
   13. load balancing
   14. API gateways
   15. Distributed Transactions/Sagas  
VERSUS
   16. Algos  

2. The job market is extremely fragmented when it comes to requested programming languages. I'm now searching for a new job and I keep having to skip listings asking for 2+ years in other languages like:  

   1. Rust
   2. Python
   3. Golang
   4. C++
   5. Java
   6. Earlang
   7. Ruby
   8. C#  

3. Sometimes it's very hard to get recognition from management. Nobody gives a shit about your postman/curl demos. Hardly anyone outside of BE development will be able to immediately understand the value of your work without a detailed explanation. People readily clap, smile, and cheer for new UI elements.  

4. You will be on-call and you will work weekends. I have never in my life heard of a FE engineer being on-call.  

5. Scale porn is rampant. Everyone wants you to scale the BE to handle 7 billion concurrent users. This is even true when interviewing at startups with ZERO concurrent users.  

6. Companies can be extremely paranoid/precious about their BE codebase. It can be excruciatingly difficult to make a case for a refactor or some other improvement to a module. Everyone is scared of breaking a BE. Everyone loves a UI refresh.  


Compare all this to simply locking in either (React, Swift, or Kotlin) and riding it out for 6+ years. Compare that to the security of working in an ecosystem/language built and maintained by a literal monopoly.

,SoftwareEngineering,"I always heard the cliche to keep friends out of business and I always took it for granted. I did freelance software engineering with my friends and it was a disaster. 

**TL;DR:** No one respected each other and the business became an unorganized joke.

1. Friends are a distraction. We were off task most of the time because we would talk to each other and BS about so much stuff. We had little organization and will to listen to each other seriously. Irrelevant conversations always snuck in and project completion times skyrocketed from what they should have been. Pair programming is a very useful system in software companies but is counterproductive with friends. Pair programming with this group always turned into group programming, which always turned into 5 people doing all the work with 5 people watching each of their screens doing nothing.
2. If everyone is a friend, then it is hard to establish a hierarchy and actually get things done. With a group of friends, it is emotionally challenging for a bunch of friends to see another friend in a boss role. This creates a lack of respect and gives everyone at the table an opportunity to challenge ideas in order to fit their self interests while hurting the interests of the company. No one wants to listen to their friend talk in a way that makes them seem like they are better than someone. Friends who have gotten used to each other will never be able to transition to roles of respect where someone is over someone else. This can also ruin the friendships because I imagine that it is hard to be friends and goof around with someone whom you had to work under the entire week and vice versa.
3. When money is involved emotions end up playing a large role. We did a project where 75% of the group did all the work and 25% did close to nothing and the 25% were very mad that they were paid accordingly. Each of the 25% justified that they spent about 1/2 of the hours of each of the 75%. The hours of work of the 75%, however, were way more valuable than the hours of work of the 25%. The 25% put in 1/2 the hours, but had almost zero impact on the final product because they were inexperienced. This became a problem as the 75% reluctantly agreed to a pity deal to pay the 25% because everyone was a friend and no one wanted to ruin friendships. That is the inherent problem with this: nothing will be fair if your friendship is on the line. If someone's feelings are in the way and they are your friend, emotions become a significant factor. The reason that this happened is because it is a group of freelancer friends and not an actual company. An actual company would have defined a set structure for payment from the very beginning. This leads to low morale and loss of opportunity to work because why would the 75% want the 25% to be involved in the next project if the 25% are just going to do nothing and take a share of the money? Surely the 75% should just do the extra work alone quicker and they get to keep the money. The only reason this happens is because of the emotional factor and friendships are on the line. Actual companies succeed because bosses are not the friends of the employees. Bosses make the tough impersonal decisions that get the company money, whether it be firing someone or adjusting pay.
4. You cannot fire anyone since they are your friends. Continuing the story above: The 75% were in favor of firing the 25% because from that experience, the 75% realized that the 25% were a liability and would only cause problems. But, of course, the emotional friend factor came into play. What are you supposed to say? ""Hey guys sorry for firing you and excluding you from the club where we make money because I think you are not worth anything positive. Anyway... lets go play some basketball.""
5. When someone is criticized, they see it as a personal attack. When someone was criticized for their work or told that we didn't like it, they took it personally and it always trickled into the personal realm. During normal group hangouts unrelated to work, the 75% would keep bringing up that the 25% should be more experienced and put in more work. This created an awkward environment for fostering friendships and made it feel like people are above others in the personal friendship realm.
6. Any hierarchy was useless. (Similar to the inability to fire someone). Every time someone deserved to be reprimanded, they would always deny their wrongdoing to the accuser and not take any punishment seriously. ""Okay, you say that I am not putting in enough effort... I'll just not care."" This happened because everyone knew that their friendship connections were guarding them from being fired or reprimanded. It is an idiotic concept. Why should your business decision have an effect on your friendship? Alas, everything always became personal. There was an incident where person A disrespected person B in front of the entire group in a very unnecessary way to prove a point that person B did something wrong when person A even agreed with Person B's point. Person B agreed with the criticism but found person A's wording very dishonest and disrespectful. They spoke privately and tensions just rose and led to awkward situations.
7. The qualifications for a good business partner are not the qualifications of a good friend. The biggest mistake was to assume that everything would run smoothly because everyone was a friend. Someone just has to like their friend and have fun with them. Someone, however, needs to respect a business partner and guarantee that they get work done. We couldn’t also just not include the unreliable members of the friend group because we though that would be rude. ""I don't want to make them feel bad. We can find something for them to do."" NO. If you want to tank a company, you pity hire people, make up useless random tasks for them to do, and then pity pay them. What I thought were competent people who could learn and adapt to software development turned into 2 groups: Those who already knew coding and software development and those who didn't. This is because no one saw this freelance group as long-term since it was just a bunch of friends. This led to people not wanting to learn  or reluctantly learning coding skills because they would not use them in the jobs of their major field, even if it was STEM.
8. Slacking off was the norm. No one wanted to come to meetings. Do you really want to listen to your friend order you to come to a meeting that you don't want to attend? Definitely not. Since people didn't take terminations and punishments seriously, there was no incentive to come to meetings. This led to only the dedicated members knowing everything and the less dedicated had no idea what the company was doing and and needed constant updates to stay relevant. If some people did not attend a meeting, the event would collapse. If your boss tells you to go to a meeting, you go to that meeting. If your friend tells you to come to a meeting and you notice 5 friends already can't go, you say ""Nah there is no point because 5 people are already not going."" The worst part of this was when work hours and meeting would devolve into videogame sessions and unrelated conversations because people had the attitude: ""There is no point of doing anything serious because only some of the group is here.""
9. Very few of the group knew how to run a business and their decisions were often drowned out or criticized by those who did not know what they were talking about. Talks of ""Hey we should get \[insert useful software or technology here\]"" turned into ""I am not helping pay for that. You can use your money if you want.""

Things I would have done differently:

1. KEEP WORK AND FRIENDS SEPARATED
2. Privately recruit members instead of the whole friend group if I chose to work with friends at all.
3. Establish a hierarchy and an attitude of no BS early on.
4. Carry out terminations and loss of privilege when appropriate.

We can find something for them to do.&amp;quot; NO. If you want to tank a company, you pity hire people, make up useless random tasks for them to do, and then pity pay them. What I thought were competent people who could learn and adapt to software development turned into 2 groups: Those who already knew coding and software development and those who didn&amp;#39;t. This is because no one saw this freelance group as long-term since it was just a bunch of friends. This led to people not wanting to learn  or reluctantly learning coding skills because they would not use them in the jobs of their major field, even if it was STEM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slacking off was the norm. No one wanted to come to meetings. Do you really want to listen to your friend order you to come to a meeting that you don&amp;#39;t want to attend? Definitely not. Since people didn&amp;#39;t take terminations and punishments seriously, there was no incentive to come to meetings. This led to only the dedicated members knowing everything and the less dedicated had no idea what the company was doing and and needed constant updates to stay relevant. If some people did not attend a meeting, the event would collapse. If your boss tells you to go to a meeting, you go to that meeting. If your friend tells you to come to a meeting and you notice 5 friends already can&amp;#39;t go, you say &amp;quot;Nah there is no point because 5 people are already not going.&amp;quot; The worst part of this was when work hours and meeting would devolve into videogame sessions and unrelated conversations because people had the attitude: &amp;quot;There is no point of doing anything serious because only some of the group is here.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very few of the group knew how to run a business and their decisions were often drowned out or criticized by those who did not know what they were talking about. Talks of &amp;quot;Hey we should get [insert useful software or technology here]&amp;quot; turned into &amp;quot;I am not helping pay for that. You can use your money if you want.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things I would have done differently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KEEP WORK AND FRIENDS SEPARATED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privately recruit members instead of the whole friend group if I chose to work with friends at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish a hierarchy and an attitude of no BS early on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carry out terminations and loss of privilege when appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an idiot for thinking this friend freelancer group could have worked.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey all,

does your company use any git analytics tools to measure productivity and manage the team? I'm referring to tools like WayDev, UseHaystack, PluralSight Flow (previously known as GitPrime). They claim to go beyond just measuring LOC and compute more advanced metrics to measure productivity, such as stuff like ""impact"" or ""throughout"".

I can see why managers would use them but I'm trying to understand from the perspective of the engineer (the one getting ""measured"" or ""managed"").

As an engineer, it seems to me there are a few issues using these tools:

1. I don't trust the metrics to paint an accurate picture of my contributions.
2. Encourages a culture of micromanaging.
3. As an employee, I feel like I'm being treated as a workhorse. My manager is just trying to increase my throughput.
4. I also don't see how it benefits me at my work (it is just a tool for my manager to collect and present metrics to his manager).

What are your thoughts on these tools? What's the context of your manager using these tools?

Edit:  really appreciate all the comments so far! Seems to me that people are generally ok if the tool is use to spot macro trends instead of measuring individual productivity. But are they really good tools for spotting trends? Aren’t these lagging indicators?

,SoftwareEngineering,"Upfront, thank you all for your time reading this!

I need some architecture/workflow advice for an app I'm building which contains: 

\- External Identity provider

\- Internal User Records, made unique by the External Id Provider's Id, then my own internal ID, used for relationship mapping

\- Client side ui is a React App

\- Backend is .NET

I've built apps before with similar structure, but this is the first time that I'm responsible for the both the Identity side, and internal user side, of the app. 

I'm having trouble engineering the best way to organize this workflow. Here are my thoughts at the moment:

\- User registers with the client side UI. Upon registration, the backend is notified of a new user and thus, creates the internal user

\- The backend is currently setup to auth with JWT, and checks that the user is authorized on each request, but it's only a proof of Authentication, *not* proof that the user is a ""registered user/customer"" in the internal systems.

I thought about implementing some methods that check the JWT info and search whether the user exists internally, and if not, create them, but that could have some serious performance issues since it would be invoked on every request.

My other option right now is to leave authentication itself on the server, but handle the above mentioned ""Existing user"" checks on the API routes themselves. I suppose this would also add another layer of security to the API.

Am I on the right path here? Should I be looking at a different implementation of user creation?

To further complicate things, the app will be a paid service at some point, so I'll need to be able to implement ""roles"" on the routes, which is why i'm leaning toward doing the same for user checks.

,SoftwareEngineering,"We asked 500+ developers and engineering leaders about software development and we finally published the report today. 

Check out the research data on the latest trends in software development. The report covers the effect of COVID, tech trends, tools, hiring, performance, and more!

**Highlight:**

**1. COVID didn’t kill the industry**

Over half of the tech companies were only minimally affected by the pandemic and almost as many experienced positive effects as negative effects.

About one in three tech companies was forced to downsize.

**2. Remote work blew up**

We’ve seen remote work become more accepted over the past few years, but now it’s literally everywhere in the software industry. Almost every tech company allows (or expects) employees to work remotely.

**3. Metrics for software engineers**

The metrics used by average- and top performers are largely similar. But top performers are more likely to pay attention to code readability, while average performers more often don’t use any metrics. This doesn’t require much explanation.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hey everyone,

I have this app (it's actually a game, but w/e) in which some data is created and edited by admins and consumed by players.

This data creation and edition is released in batches, so all the time there is a production data and some draft data that will be promoted to production as soon as it is finished and validated. All this data is stored in a somewhat complex and hierarchical database structure.

Imagine, for example, Hearthstone. There's card data stored in database, but designers can edit some draft data until they consider it polished and release a patch. I know that HS is probably not handled like this, but that's an example.

I was wondering if in the moment of the promotion of draft data to production, would it make sense to load it into some in memory db technology such as Redis since it's going to be immutable until the next update.

Am I overcomplicating stuff? I think that the queries will be faster and actually simpler if I do it because I will not load the history of versions and some other metadata.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi there!  


I am currently taking an MSc in Software Development coming from a humanities background (in the UK if that matters). So far the rest of the course has been ok but I am really struggling with my software engineering module. We've been given a group project in which we have to use iterative and incremental development to make a game. The project itself is ok I understand the different UML diagrams required as well as how to actually program the game. My issue stems from the technical report we have to write on it. 

As I said above I come from a humanities background so I have never written or even seen a technical report before. I have zero frame of reference for what it should be like, my other modules (web dev and databases) provided sample reports to show us roughly what the finished product should look like but this module has nothing but a requirements guideline. When I emailed my lecturer about this he said he didn't have any kind of examples for a report, said I just needed the diagrams and the facts and just copy and pasted part of the requirements at me.  

It's due in a couple of weeks and I am beyond stressed about it, I think I have all the info required I genuinely just have no idea what to do with it and what to say about it in a report.

But often it's followed by ""unless"" statement. It goes more less like this:

""
Always go with refactor, unless:
- code is not maintainable
- adding features takes tremendous amount of time
- each change creates bugs in different parts of the system
- code is lacking any structure
- redesigning a component results in a complete rewrite of that component anyway, because the existing design is so fubar that there's nothing worth saving
- the coupling of components is so high that changes to a single component cannot be isolated from other components (redesign of a single component results in a cascade of changes not only to adjacent components, but indirectly to all components)
- onboarding of new developers takes long weeks
""

... and then comes my project (a transactional module within e-commerce application), where all of the above are true and yet people advice me to go with refactor.

&lt;p&gt;But often it&amp;#39;s followed by &amp;quot;unless&amp;quot; statement. It goes more less like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;
Always go with refactor, unless:
- code is not maintainable
- adding features takes tremendous amount of time
- each change creates bugs in different parts of the system
- code is lacking any structure
- redesigning a component results in a complete rewrite of that component anyway, because the existing design is so fubar that there&amp;#39;s nothing worth saving
- the coupling of components is so high that changes to a single component cannot be isolated from other components (redesign of a single component results in a cascade of changes not only to adjacent components, but indirectly to all components)
- onboarding of new developers takes long weeks
&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;... and then comes my project (a transactional module within e-commerce application), where all of the above are true and yet people advice me to go with refactor.&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"Don't get me wrong, I'm first to help and train younger colleagues, but sometimes (actually very often) there are people who just shouldn't be into software development at all.

Few noticeable examples from last few days, is when guy was testing a method which gives 50% discount on order (division by 2) with an assert that takes input and divide it by 2 as well (so copied the exact body of the tested function).

I've spent 30mins explaining him why it's wrong, and he was so defensive about his code that I lost hope.

Another guy created a function that returns bool, but also inside the function made that it returns TRUE for invalid input, which is separate business case. Basically function has 3 possible outputs, but he choose boolean as return (and no exceptions). Then he coded usage if this function around these limitations (a hack). I've spent an hour explaining him that this function is losing piece of information, and next developers who'd like to consume that function would be confused.

Again, guy was super defensive, couldn't admit or couldn't comprehend this issue.

So it makes no profit at the moment since the development of it was never intended for commercial purposes. I never pitched it to anyone nor never said to anyone I want to sell it. He's making the offer.

This is what he sent me. I'll use hashtags in place of the CEO name and the company:

I'm going to need you to give me a price of me buying you out.

And at a 100%. Meaning I will own it.

I'll take a look at your offer and after a couple of months, will give you direct feedback to your offer and if I like it, we will begin the paper work.

Thanks

Yours Faithfully

\########### CEO

\###########

So we've actually known each other for a couple months now, and he did make it clear that he's interested in the app more than once.

He knows that a lot of work would still have to be in to get it near a competitive level, since right now as it stands, it just has basic features and mediocre design.

I'm thinking perhaps I should let him buy since he may make more use of it then I have.

What offer should I put down.

I assume the time I put into it would be one of the factors I should consider, which was 6 months of work, from start to finish.

I wouldn't mind hanging to a percentage of the app, but not too much that I have to be the one still putting work into it. I wouldn't mind profiting, but I have no interest to continue working on the app myself.

I'd appreciate some advice.  


Edit: Just want to let everyone know that I am reading everyone's feedback and I appreciate everyone's advice. I'll try to respond to some of the comments that have questions in them.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hi there! I've been working as Software Engineer almost 2 years now mostly with technologies like Go, GCP, Terraform, Graphana, InfluxDB, PosterSQL and for some time with AWS Lambdas.

In meantime I've done like 20 small/medium projects. Most of them were abonded because I didn't see anything to learn from them anymore. That's basically how i do. I come up with an idea, do main part of some project and if it becomes boring or new things to me have ended I abandon it. I like it that way because I do only new things and what I want to do is to learn as much as possible.

I've recently done 2 small projects aiming in learning AWS EC2, Lambda, SNS, VPC and maintaining it with Terraform. I know that I'm not expert with that but I got the idea :) 

I want to keep aiming on learning AWS related things but I need project idea because I find it easier that way instead of just learning about pure AWS or anything else. I also wanted to learn software engineer/programming related technologies like Redis, ELK stack or Kafka.

&lt;p&gt;In meantime I&amp;#39;ve done like 20 small/medium projects. Most of them were abonded because I didn&amp;#39;t see anything to learn from them anymore. That&amp;#39;s basically how i do. I come up with an idea, do main part of some project and if it becomes boring or new things to me have ended I abandon it. I like it that way because I do only new things and what I want to do is to learn as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently done 2 small projects aiming in learning AWS EC2, Lambda, SNS, VPC and maintaining it with Terraform. I know that I&amp;#39;m not expert with that but I got the idea :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to keep aiming on learning AWS related things but I need project idea because I find it easier that way instead of just learning about pure AWS or anything else. I also wanted to learn software engineer/programming related technologies like Redis, ELK stack or Kafka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How dou you guys find project ideas? Skip sentences like &amp;quot;do what you are interested in&amp;quot; etc :D

,SoftwareEngineering," Hi Guys,

I need your views on a problem statement that I have been working on for the last few months.

The model that I am building is a text-based model, where the users enter some sentences every day and select the target labels. The model gets trained right when the user enters a sentence and a label.

The targets are specific to only that user. The user has the ability to create a target label on the fly and the model gets trained. In this case, the model gets trained with the new target label and can predict is the next time onwards.

For example, the user can enter:

Note number | Sentence | Target

1| I eat a banana | Fruit

2| I cleaned my house | Task

3| I went jogging | Walk

I am using a Naive Bayes model for this and it works perfectly fine.

The catch is that the target labels are not fixed. And I need to scale this across many users (close to 1000). User 1 can have 10 labels and user 2 can have a completely different set of 7 labels. Also, some set of words can mean something else for user 1, and something else for user 2 (For example- Jogging means Walk for user 1, but means Exercise for user 2). So, conceptually there is no way I can combine the data of multiple users to create a global model because other users' data can contaminate the probabilities of the labels, even if I keep userID as a feature.

Now. the model size is never more than 1-1.5MB for a single user. My question is that does it make sense to create a per-user model, or is there a way to create a global model. Also, please do not suggest neural networks because I need to make them cheap + highly accurate + fast. The naive Bayes model works perfectly for a single user system.

I have never worked with such a setup where we can have a per-user model. Is this something common in the industry? I will be deploying this on AWS, and as per my experience and also while preparing for the ML specialty exam, I learned that we can deploy a model in Sagemaker, BUT usually it is used for a global model.

**In short, my question is that is this a common approach in the industry to have many small but powerful per-user models? If yes, how do you deploy this? (AWS specific answers would be greatly appreciated)**

For those who may have concerns about model evaluation, I have a framework to measure the performance of these models, and model diagnostic is mostly on the NLP logic that we use on the text, so it is common for all users. And since Naive Bayes does not have many hyperparameters to tune, I have created a self-healing self-learning model, and it works well for 1 user system without any changes to the model.

I can elaborate on this if you have any questions.

For the 2nd time in my career I have joined an organisation which duct taped its core project codebase (you know, spaghetti, lack of any architecture, no dry, race conditions, business logic in SQL, etc.).

Second organisation however, spends millions monthly per marketing only, not mentioning salaries of 200-300 people in tech department.

,SoftwareEngineering," We traced it to a particular piece of code. It was complex. It was slow. And it had no test coverage.

The first impulse was to jump in and ""improve"" the ugly bits. But there were too many scenarios. For each combination of inputs, we had to ensure it still gives the same output afterwards.

It's hard enough to add unit tests to legacy code. We were facing the cost of creating myriads of tests. And manual testing was out of the question.

Fortunately, this is nothing new in software development, and other developers have suggested various tricks for handling such situations.

Using one of these techniques, I got us a smooth ui performance within a couple of hours, with *no new tests required*, and *without breaking anything*. I call it the record-and-compare test.

Here's how it works.

1. Identify the piece of code needing a change. It could be spread over several functions, several classes.
2. Create a throw-away library and paste this code into it. Create a single function to execute it. Add parameters to the function, for whatever the code requires to run.
3. Follow the compiler errors. If a missing dependency affects the behaviour of your code, then copy-paste it into your library. If not, then mock it out.
4. Write all output of the code into a text file. This includes return values, output parameters, events fired, database updates. Any side-effects.
5. Make unpredictable output predictable. If you execute your function with the same parameters twice, you should get exactly the same output. Make new database id's zero-based. Make dates based from a relative start date. Etc.
6. Create a single unit test, make it iterate through all the combinations of your function's input parameters, and execute it repeatedly. Use your knowledge of the business domain to exclude nonsense input.
7. Run the test and rename the output file to something like ""*expected-results.txt*""
8. Add a single assert condition: confirm the actual results equals the expected.
9. Add a timer.

Now you can refactor and improve the code, until you get the best performance. All the while executing your test to ensure you're not breaking something. Once done, copy your changes back into the real code base, and throw away your temporary test library.

If you think about it, you'll notice this technique also applies to other refactoring needs, not just performance improvements.",t2_2a1dvrh8,False,,0,False,"We were stuck fixing an ""unacceptably slow"" bug.",[],r/SoftwareEngineering,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_mh8pid,False,dark,0.79,,public,11,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,11,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1617233658.0,text,6,,,text,self.SoftwareEngineering,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We traced it to a particular piece of code.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello all! About 3 weeks ago, I began interviewing for software development jobs for the first time in my life. I am a career switcher (used to be in finance), and learned to code self-taught through 2 tech startups I founded. Going into the market, I have been completely lost as to what level or company to place myself in to increase my odds of success. Not only do I not have a CS degree, but I’ve also never been an engineer-employee and, being a business owner, have not even been an employee in 4 years.

I have 2 years hands-on programming experience but 4 years experience managing software projects and engineers. 

I have some feedback from the market that I thought I could share, and maybe you guys could advise me as to 1)what size/industry company to go after, and 2) what position. 

The Good News: 
The positive response to my resume has been overwhelming. After a few hours of pure online cold outreach, I got 20 job interviews within 3 weeks. Something like a third of these interviews were from companies and recruiters who reached out to me. These positions are generally flat “software developer” roles or in rare instances “engineering manager.”

The Bad News: 
I do great at behavioral, leadership and general tech knowledge interviews, but so far, seemingly not good enough on the actual coding parts. I’m petrified of live coding in front of other people; I hate coding with a timer on; and I refuse to get into leet code. I’m happiest when it’s a coding project I’m being evaluated on, and second happiest on non-supervised tests. Sometimes I feel what job I get is less about the pay/level/company, and more about what interview process the company is using, and whether that feeds into my weaknesses or strengths. My score on timed coding tests are 19/20, 4/5, 2/3 and, in a live coding, feedback that my code was at a more “junior” level. None of this has so far been good enough. 

The Results: 
Tiny (&lt;15 people) startups love me but reject me (it’s kind of mutual) because they need an expert coder that can do full stack (I can’t) 

Small startups (20-100 people) are on the border. They either go ahead with me, or depending on how many engineers they have, they say they want to reach back out to me in 1 month, 6 months, 1 year etc, when they have more seniors in place to train me. One mid size company said I should try for engineer manager role because of my management experience. 

No big company has interviewed me. 

My current plan is to just keep applying, hoping for projects, or for a friendly coding test at the flat software engineer level. It’s exhausting though to do all the tests and projects. 

Any advice on how to target so my chances are better? What should I be applying to?

So I got accused of ""over-engineering"". And for a while there, I dangled dangerously close to that cliff called ""the prima donna developer"".

This was one of my earlier positions. I was still coming to terms with this divide between management's need for getting things done, and the developer's need to do things right.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Hello everyone, thanks for taking the time to read this. 

I'm about 3 years into my career, got into a software engineer position fresh out of college, no prior internships/experience. I also took lots of gaps in my college career so my technical knowledge was/is very spotty. This company helped me grow so fast, my technical skillset grew exponentially the first year, year and a half. This was probably the most challenging time because I had so little to bring from what I learned and had to learn a whole bunch of stuff, but it was also the most satisfying/fun because I felt like I've accomplished so much more in a year than the previous 5-6 years I spent in school. I worked hard and I was able to get recognition for my input and I was given more responsibilities as a developer to lead parts of feature/project releases.

But then due to having lost our team leads, I was given **even more** responsibilities (managing &amp; leading projects) , and that landed me in a senior position on my second year (note: this company also overinflates titles/roles so I'm more of a engineer II at best). Now fast forward a whole year -- I find myself spending 95% of my day delegating/researching or designing/doing the grunt work that the previous team lead would have done, and the other 5% of my day is maybe filled with actual coding work. I'm not sure that there is a plan to find a replacement for the lead role, and I'm not comfortable with even attempting the position because I know I still don't have the fundamental technical skillset down.

More and more, I've been finding myself unhappy and resentful with my current role vs responsibilities and I have so much going on in my mind that I'm honestly not sure what to do. Here are what I've been thinking of:


- I've tried picking up the interview/coding books from the dusty bookshelves, but it's overwhelming having to go through algorithms &amp; data structures that I haven't used since the last time I was prepping for interviews, and just the stress from work doesn't help with my lack of motivation to study or do anything related to programming.
- They recently modified our title hierarchy and made a engineer II role and I've considered taking a demotion in hopes that I could actually go back to doing heads-down coding and the company finding a replacement lead.
- I lack the work/life balance and this has not been any better with permanent remote work + living alone, so work is basically my life. Would picking up a new hobby or going through with adopting a pet (I've been considering this for years even before covid) help destress?

I guess I don't necessarily have an answer or reply I'm looking for, but I was just curious as to how many people out there are in a similar situation and how they're handling it or if they're not in a similar situation, what sort of suggestions they have. And a general question for those who end up reading this -- do you guys code/work on projects outside of work?

&lt;p&gt;But then due to having lost our team leads, I was given &lt;strong&gt;even more&lt;/strong&gt; responsibilities (managing &amp;amp; leading projects) , and that landed me in a senior position on my second year (note: this company also overinflates titles/roles so I&amp;#39;m more of a engineer II at best). Now fast forward a whole year -- I find myself spending 95% of my day delegating/researching or designing/doing the grunt work that the previous team lead would have done, and the other 5% of my day is maybe filled with actual coding work. I&amp;#39;m not sure that there is a plan to find a replacement for the lead role, and I&amp;#39;m not comfortable with even attempting the position because I know I still don&amp;#39;t have the fundamental technical skillset down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more, I&amp;#39;ve been finding myself unhappy and resentful with my current role vs responsibilities and I have so much going on in my mind that I&amp;#39;m honestly not sure what to do. Here are what I&amp;#39;ve been thinking of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried picking up the interview/coding books from the dusty bookshelves, but it&amp;#39;s overwhelming having to go through algorithms &amp;amp; data structures that I haven&amp;#39;t used since the last time I was prepping for interviews, and just the stress from work doesn&amp;#39;t help with my lack of motivation to study or do anything related to programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They recently modified our title hierarchy and made a engineer II role and I&amp;#39;ve considered taking a demotion in hopes that I could actually go back to doing heads-down coding and the company finding a replacement lead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I lack the work/life balance and this has not been any better with permanent remote work + living alone, so work is basically my life. Would picking up a new hobby or going through with adopting a pet (I&amp;#39;ve been considering this for years even before covid) help destress?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I don&amp;#39;t necessarily have an answer or reply I&amp;#39;m looking for, but I was just curious as to how many people out there are in a similar situation and how they&amp;#39;re handling it or if they&amp;#39;re not in a similar situation, what sort of suggestions they have. And a general question for those who end up reading this -- do you guys code/work on projects outside of work? If so how much time do you spend on it per day/week and how do you find the motivation to do it?&lt;/p&gt;

,SoftwareEngineering,"I am the lead developer on a SaaS product built with Node, TypeScript and Angular. The product needs to be blazingly fast in order to compete and we are a small team. I have made several code optimizations, moved some stuff to background services and generally I am trying to squeeze every bit of performance from database queries. Recently, the marketing team requested an extensive metrics &amp; analytics refactor. Up until now we had been tracking some very basic user actions like Sign Up, Sign In, Plan Upgrades etc but they are now asking for more and more info to be sent over to Segment. They claim that information like that is crucial to product growth but moves like that will definitely go against performance. 

For example, there's an endpoint that allows the batch deletion of posts the user has made that translates into a DELETE FROM table WHERE ids IN (...) raw query. But the event that needs to be tracked requires that we send all columns for every single one of these posts. I don't think it's a good idea to make a SELECT query, sometimes those posts that the user deletes can be hundreds.

The solutions I have though about are the following:

- move event tracking to a background worker (This does not solve the added load on the database which happens to be a low tier db on AWS RDS as we are on a very strict budget)

- move event tracking on the client-side even though I am not sure about the impact on user experience that this is gonna have.

- reject their request for tracking every single user action.

,SoftwareEngineering,"Backstory, I am a senior software engineer for a small software engineering company.  I have been there for 5 years now. 2 months ago I was approached and asked if I would like to be a project manager, I said yes, and then they came back the next month and said I have it.  They also asked me if I would like to cover for our customer relations/sales person position this summer when he goes on leave for about 3 months, which I also agreed to but wanted to know what my compensation would be, aka salary increase.  I also run the summer internship program at our company, basically hire and mentor new interns all summer.

So I asked them for the salary details, job description, training schedule, when do I officially start the position, etc.  Multiple times.  I have basically been given excuses about they need to get details together, etc.

Fast forward to now, I have been in client meetings, manager meetings, they announced my promotion to the other PMs, and been given a plan for which client and project I will be managing but NO SALARY INFO YET.  Although I have not technically started in the position yet.

I have also been moved on to a temporary project as an unofficial tech lead until I officially begin my project management position in about a month.  Which also should command a higher pay.

So I really didnt want all this extra responsibility if the salary increase wasnt worth it.  But I feel like I have basically said yes, thinking I would get the salary info up front but havnt received it yet, and they are saying they will give me my full ""promotion report"" next month.

So does anyone know what kind of salary I should expect?   Should I ask for extra for filling in for the sales position during the summer?  The sales position now does not include any commission and is salary based.  Also is this normal to get a promotion then the company be like, I'll get back with you on that, and slowly, randomly start to roll you on?
