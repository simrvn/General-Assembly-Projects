# Project 2: AMES Housing Dataset and Kaggle Competition

---

### Problem Statement

The problem that we are trying to solve is predicting the sale prices of a property using linear regression models.


---

### Executive Summary 

The Ames Housing Dataset is a robust dataset comprising of over 2000 rows and 81 columns. The dataset was split into two, Train Dataset and Test Dataset. The Train Dataset is our hold-out dataset. To carry out this analysis, the following processes were undertaken.

1. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

    - This involved examining the data and looking for missing values for both the Train and Test Datasets.
    - Followed by feature classification, where we categorise the features based on their datatypes and analyse them separately.
    - Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted on the categorised features as well to look for features that were highly skewed, as well as outliers and/or peculiar data.
    - Outliers were identified and removed if deemed necessary
    - Muliticollinerity was identified amongst features and removed to prevent any form of penalisations to our models later.

2. Data Preprocessing

    - One hot encoding was done to our nominal features so that we can model them later. (Note: dummy variable trap was not taken care of
    - Ordinal and Categorical data were scaled thereafter
    - Train Test Split was conducted on our hold out set to train our data before predicting prices on the test dataset.

3. Modelling

    - Regression Models were created to identify the best model to predict prices. Lasso Regression Model held the lowest RMSE and hence is the best model
    
4. Kaggle

    - Model was implemented on Test Dataset and submitted to Kaggle. Kaggle score was turned out to be higher.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on our final model, it shows that neighborhoods such as Stone Brook and Northridge Heights have properties of high values. Single-family detached properties also have high coefficient value showcasing high property value. The overall quality of the property as well as the above ground living areas are important features in predicting prices of house as well.

On the other hand properties in Northwest Ames have lower sale prices. A property's age also affects the sale price of the property as well i.e. older the property, lower the sale.

Recommendations:

1. Property dealers/buyers should consider properties in Stone Brook, Northridge Heights and Northridge Neighbourhoods for investment purposes as they yield higher sale prices. Will be more beneficial if property age is low as well. Also look into single-family detached properties/Hill side properties

2. Consider renovating to Brick Face exterior covering

3. Sell properties earlier as older properties yield lower sales

4. Avoid Masonry veneer types such as Brick Common.
